/** 
 * Defines the functionallity of a CachedAuthorizationContextHierarchyGenerator.
 * The necessity of such an interface is dictated by the fact that the
 * authorization hierarchy is quite independent of the authorization methods.
 * For example, an application might store the hierarchy on a file system, but
 * use a database authorization method. The interface abstracts the concept
 * of an authorization hierarchy. Consequently, by passing a 
 * AuthorizationContextHierarchyGenerator to an authorization method, the method will
 * not have to care about the way the hierarchy is stored and/or retrieved.
