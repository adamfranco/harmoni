/**
 * <code>FlowLayout</code> is the most simple <code>Layout</code>; it renders a 
 * container by simply rendering all of the container's components. The width, height,
 * and alignment options of the container and its components are ignored. No special 
 * arranging is done, and it is up to the browser or user to display the components properly. 
 * <br><br>
 * Contrary to what one might think, this could be a very useful <code>Layout</code>. 
 * For eaxmple, it could be used to display components that are just 
 * <code>div</code> elements with aboslute positioning.
 * <br><br>
 * Layouts are assigned to Containers and they specify how (in terms of location, 
 * not appearance) the sub-<code>Components</code> are going to be rendered on the screen.
