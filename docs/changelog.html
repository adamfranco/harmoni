			existance of children.
		 (<i>Adam Franco</i>)
		<li/> New feature:  
			Implemented Authority-Lists for Record Parts. These lists are accessed
			through the PartStructure. These lists are intended to be used to

	</ul><br/><h2>Version 0.4.0</h2><h3>2005-10-12</h3><ul>
		<li/> Change:  
			Groups and Agents are now stored in the hierarchy, allowing authorizations
			to be placed on them as qualifiers. This allows for specific authorizations 
			as to who can modify which groups or users.
		 (<i>Adam Franco</i>)
		<li/> Change:  
			Added a check for magic_quotes_gpc being Off in harmoni.inc.php.
		 (<i>Gabe Schine</i>)

        			#102448</a> 
			Implemented (but did not yet test) Oracle database connectivity.
		 (<i>Gabe Schine</i>)
		<li/> Change:  
			Changed DBHandler's toDBDate functionality to automatically format and include
			quotations if necessary for the specific DB type. This became a problem
			for Oracle databases where a function call is necessary for date storage.
		 (<i>Gabe Schine</i>)
		<li/> New feature:  
			Added getStringName() to the Database interface and added a method in the DBHandler to allows access
			to the string name based on the database index.
		 (<i>Gabe Schine</i>)
		<li/> Change: <a href="http://sourceforge.net/pm/task.php?func=detailtask&amp;group_id=82873&amp;group_project_id=37898&amp;project_task_id=116890">

			All DataManager database queries now free() their results after processing.
		 (<i>Gabe Schine</i>)
		<li/> New feature:  
			GUIManager now allows for the setting of pre and post HTML. These are 
			HTML tags that need to surround a compontent. This is primarily used to 
			properly nest form-tags around tables/divs to generate valid XHTML.
		 (<i>Adam Franco</i>)
		<li/> Bug Fix:
	 
			Repaired many PHP notices.
		 (<i>Adam Franco</i>)

		 (<i>Gabe Schine</i>)
		<li/> Bug Fix:
	 
			Repaired many PHP notices.
		 (<i>Niraj Dhungel</i>)
		<li/> Bug Fix:
	 
			The hierarchy cache had a problem where _isCached() was called as a property
			instead of a method, square brackets [] versus parenthasis (), and was breaking
			the cache by creating nodes that were listed as children of other nodes, but did
			not have their parents listed.
		 (<i>Adam Franco</i>)
		<li/> Change:  
			The Chronology Library as well as the dataManager primitives have now
			been moved to core/Primitives and generalized.
		 (<i>Adam Franco</i>)
		<li/> Change:  
			The Time and DateTime classes have been removed and their functionality
			replaced by the new Chronology DateAndTime class.
		 (<i>Adam Franco</i>)
		<li/> Change:  
			DataManager:
			
			Records no longer have an active state. They either exist or they don't.
			
			Fields that are deleted now are actually removed from the DB if the Record is
			not version controlled.
			
			getIndices() now returns only the active indices per default, including inactive
			ones only if requested.
		 (<i>Gabe Schine</i>)
		<li/> New feature:  
			Added a free() call to the SelectQueryResult classes to free
			memory used by the select query.
		 (<i>Gabe Schine</i>)
		<li/> New feature:  
			Added the chronology library, a PHP implemenation of the Squeak (Smalltalk) 
			Kernel-Chronology package and aims to serve as a general PHP 
			class-library for handling, comparing, and operating on chronological 
			objects. The original Smalltalk implementation is licensed under the 
			Squeak License http://squeak.org/download/license.html.
			
			This library includes classes that represent instants in time 
			(DateAndTime, TimeStamp), lengths of time (Duration), spans of time 
			anchored at certain instants (Timespan, Year, Month, Week, Date), as 
			well as recuring instants across a span of time (Schedule).
			
			This library has been designed to support all possible dates, times, and 
			durations, not just those since the UNIX epoch (1970). dates can have 
			positive years (C.E./A.D.) or negative years (B.C.E./B.C.) and Durations 
			have been tested to support lengths of time up to +/- 4 billion years with 
			second-precision. Beyond 4 billion years to the limit of testing (50 billion 
			years) Durations have hour-precision.
		 (<i>Adam Franco</i>)
		<li/> New feature:  
			Added URL-writing functionality as well as centralized processing
			of request-related variables from/to the browser into a family
			of classes related to the RequestHandler. 

			All 'communication' between the browser and the program is now
			abstracted and can be subsequently changed transparently.
		 (<i>Gabe Schine</i>)
		<li/> Change:  
			In order to allow for globally unique ids from the IdManager, the
			IdManager now allows for an Id prefix to place on ids. The prefix 
			'id.middlebury.edu-' would lead to ids simmilar to 
			'id.middlebury.edu-1234567890'. This will allow for multiple IdManagers
			to be used together without each giving out the same Id strings.
		 (<i>Adam Franco</i>)
		<li/> Change:  
			In conjunction with the IdManager's added 'prefix' capabilities,
			the Harmoni SQL table definitions have been updated to support the
			storing of string Ids (currently up to 75 characters) that may have
			originated from the IdManager. Ids generated internally by the database
			remain as integers.
		 (<i>Adam Franco</i>)
		<li/> Change:  
			In conjunction with the IdManager's added 'prefix' capabilities,
			the Harmoni services that store Ids have been upgraded to allow 
			string ids as well as integer ids.

			If magic_quotes_gpc is on Harmoni now just strips slashes on the G/P/C
			arrays instead of dying with errors.
		 (<i>Adam Franco</i>)
		<li/><span style="color: red">*** IMPORTANT ***</span> Change:  
			Harmoni now runs on PHP5 and on Win32 systems in addition to PHP4.3 and
			POSIX systems.

	</ul><br/><h2>Version 0.3.1</h2><h3>2005-04-11</h3><ul>
		<li/> Change:  
			Authentication now plays nicely with GET parameters and maintains them
			around during the authentication sequence.
		 (<i>Adam Franco</i>)
		<li/> Change:  
			Agent searching works with new mapping system.
		 (<i>Adam Franco</i>)
	</ul><br/><h2>Version 0.3.0</h2><h3>2005-04-07</h3><ul>
		<li/> Change:  
			New Framework/Architecture-GUI/Theme interaction decouples the Harmoni
			object from the output system. The GUIManager and other OutputHandlers
			extend the OutputHandler abstract class and can be attached to Harmoni.
			A default 'BasicOutputHandler' is used when no other OutputHandler is
			specified.
		 (<i>Adam Franco</i>)
		<li/> Change:  
			Services::startService(), Services::stopService(), Services::restartService(), 
			and Services::startAll() are now deprecated and print warnings if used.
			Please use Services::startManagerAsService() and/or Services::getService() 
			instead.
		 (<i>Adam Franco</i>)
		<li/> Change:  
			'Service' classes no longer extend the services interface or use
			start()/stop() methods. These had been designed into Harmoni, but were
			never used and are now removed. start()/stop() methods will NOT be
			called during service starting/stopping.
		 (<i>Adam Franco</i>)
		<li/> Change:  
			OKI version 1 interfaces and implementations have been removed, saving
			2MB of files and cleaning up the source tree.
		 (<i>Adam Franco</i>)
		<li/> Change:  
			The hierarchy's Tree class, HierarchyManager/tree/Tree.class.php, now 
			caches its traversal results. (Savings: 93,529 calls to tree-&gt;_traverse(), 
			43 seconds execution time on a 500MHz PC in a 5000-node hierarchy)
		 (<i>Adam Franco</i>)
		<li/> New feature:  
			ValidatorRule objects can now be accessed via static
			XxxxxValidatorRule::getRule() methods, allowing the ValidatorRule classes
			to behave as Singletons and avoid the instantiation of tens of thousands
			of ValidatorRule objects.
		 (<i>Adam Franco</i>)
		<li/> New feature:  
			GUI Manager now complete. ThemeHandler and LayoutHandler have been
			removed.
		 (<i>Dobo Radichkov</i>)
		<li/> New feature:

			Authentication is completely handled by the AuthenticationManager
			OSID implementation instead of the LoginHandler/AuthenticationHandler.
			The LoginHandler and AuthenticationHandler have been removed.
		 (<i>Adam Franco</i>)
		<li/> New feature:  
			New back-end for managing authentication tokens, agents, and the mappings
			between agents and authentication tokens. This is all contained within
			the core/oki2/agentmanagement/ directory.
		 (<i>Adam Franco</i>)
		<li/> Change:  
			DBHandler now provides methods for transaction handling. Applications
			can be coded to use transactions to ensure atomic writes. Databases
			that do not support transactions will simply ignore the calls. Nested
			transaction calls in MySQL are interperated so that only the outer 
			transaction is run allowing applications coded to use nested transactions
			to often operate on MySQL 4.0.11+.
		 (<i>Adam Franco</i>)
		<li/> New feature:  
			Now includes implementations of v2.0 of the O.K.I OSIDs.

		<li/> Bug Fix:
	 
			AuthorizationManager now handles group membership.
		 (<i>Adam Franco</i>)
		<li/> Change:  
			AuthorizationManager now properly returns implicit AZ corresponding to
			explicit AZs at a parent instead of returning the explict AZs themselves.
		 (<i>Adam Franco</i>)
		<li/> Change:  
			DataManager: added function to SchemaManager to generate valid PHP code 
			for a given Schema.
		 (<i>Gabe Schine</i>)
		<li/> Change:  
			DataManager: deleting a value from a Record without version control now 
			actually deletes the value instead of flagging it as inactive.
		 (<i>Gabe Schine</i>)
		<li/> Change:  
			The LanguageLocalizer now defines functions for _() and gettext() that
			simply return the passed string, so that localized apps can fail
			gracefully to their native language if gettext is not installed.
		 (<i>Adam Franco</i>)
		<li/> Change:  
			DBHandler improvements: SQL strings are prettier now. Also added variable
			binding functionallity.
		 (<i>Dobo Radichkov</i>)

			Added a "MIME" service for sniffing mime types from file extensions.
		 (<i>Adam Franco</i>)
		<li/> New feature:  
			Added an ImageProcessor service for the resizing of images, generation
			of thumbnails, and other common image processing functions. This service
			can be configured to use multiple modules to handle different file types,
			as availible. An example would be using PHP's GD libraries for handling
			jpegs and pngs, while using ImageMagick (via shell_exec()) for tiff,
			psd, pdf, etc. files.
		 (<i>Adam Franco</i>)
		<li/> Bug Fix:
	 
			DBHandler: PostgreSQL now functions without throwing invalid errors.
		 (<i>Adam Franco</i>)

			Harmoni::executeLogin() executes the LoginHandler and stores the result to avoid discrepancies.
		 (<i>Gabe Schine</i>)
		<li/> Change:  
			Migrated OKI DR implementation to use new DataManager.
		 (<i>Gabe Schine</i>)
		<li/> Change:  
			DataManager: Records now dynamically update their fetch-mode (how much &amp; what data has been fetched) depending on the operation to be performed. Previous version required one to manually re-fetch records (annoying).
		 (<i>Gabe Schine</i>)
		<li/> New feature:  
			Function printDebugBacktrace([$traceArray]) will print out a debug_backtrace() in a pretty way.
		 (<i>Gabe Schine</i>)

		<li/> New feature:  
			Implimented the Digital Repository OSID in Harmoni. The DR uses the Hierarchy OSID,
			the DataManager, and the Shared OSID to provide for high-level access and browsing
			of Assets and their associated data/metadata.
		 (<i>Adam Franco</i>)
		<li/> Change:  
			Services: The Harmoni Services now check for the Error Handler and use that
			to print out errors if it is availible. This makes for easier to read backtraces.
		 (<i>Adam Franco</i>)
		<li/> Change:  
			DBHandler: DBHandler now throws fatal errors with an explanation when a query
			fails.
		 (<i>Adam Franco</i>)
		<li/> New feature:  
			Hierarchy: Implimented the Hierarchy OSID. The Hiearchy supports the storing
			of multiple hierarchies and their nodes in one database. In the current 
			implimentation, the entire hierarchy is pulled from the database each load. This
			needs to be re-written to optimize it for fast reads from 100,000+ node
			hierarchy (current Segue at Middlebury has ~50,000 nodes).
		 (<i>Adam Franco</i>)
		<li/> New feature:  
			DataManager: added DataSet caching to the DataSetManager. Added support for required fields
			in DataSetTypeDefinitions.
		 (<i>Gabe Schine</i>)

		 (<i>Gabe Schine</i>)
		<li/> Change:  
			DataManager: sped up fetching large numbers of DataSets at once (by a factor of two).
		 (<i>Gabe Schine</i>)
		<li/> Change:  
			DataManager: DataSet::prune() now takes a required VersionConstraint object on which to base the
			pruning process. Handling of pruning Tags is very very messy, but it works.
		 (<i>Gabe Schine</i>)
		<li/> New feature:  
			DataManager: can use DataSetManager::selectIDsBySearch() to search all/some DataSets and return
			a list of DataSets that match the criteria.
		 (<i>Gabe Schine</i>)
		<li/> Change:  
			DataManager: ValueVersion::prune() now deletes itself if the DataSet it is part of is inactive.
		 (<i>Gabe Schine</i>)
		<li/> Change:  
			DataManager: DataSet::prune() now removes all Tags associated with itself.
		 (<i>Gabe Schine</i>)

		<li/> New feature:  
			Classes: Timer and QueryCounter for easy micro-second timing or DB query counting, respectively.
		 (<i>Gabe Schine</i>)
		<li/> Change:  
			Harmoni::getData has been deprecated and replaced by Harmoni::getAttachedData to avoid ambiguity.
		 (<i>Gabe Schine</i>)

		<li/> Bug Fix:
	 
			DataSet::populate() now sets its own ID to avoid super re-duplication of DataSets in database.
		 (<i>Gabe Schine</i>)
		<li/> Bug Fix:
	 
			DateTime::now() now gives correct Hour value. Likewise MySQLDatabase::toDBDate() now adds 1 to hour value
			to give correct 1-24 value. Other DB Types haven't yet been checked.
		 (<i>Gabe Schine</i>)
		<li/> Change:  
			Modified field in HarmoniDataManager table "datasetfield" from "datasetfield_created" to "datasetfield_modified"
			since it is updated on every commit().
		 (<i>Gabe Schine</i>)
		<li/> New feature:  
			Extensive work on DataManager. Now works for creating/retrieving datasets with version controls.
		 (<i>Gabe Schine</i>)
		<li/> Bug Fix:
	 
			Corrected ArgumentValidator call in DBHandler checking for DateTimeInterface instead of DateTime.
		 (<i>Gabe Schine</i>)
		<li/> New feature:  
			Added AgentInformationHandler::agentExists($name, [$method]) which steps through each AuthenticationMethod
			and checks for an existing agent.
		 (<i>Gabe Schine</i>)
		<li/> Change:  
			LoginState now has better support for Active/Authenticated agents. It should allow one to change
			the active agent without disturbing the actual authentication process.
		 (<i>Gabe Schine</i>)
	</ul><br/><h2>Version 0.0.4</h2><h3>2003-12-06</h3><ul>
		<li/> New feature:

			by referencing Context::actionPath.
		 (<i>Gabe Schine</i>)
		<li/> Change:

		 (<i>Gabe Schine</i>)
		<li/> Change:  
			Removed many .interface.php files to save on load times and unnecessary flexibility.
		 (<i>Gabe Schine</i>)
		<li/> Change:  
			LoginHandler no longer throws a default error on login failure. LoginHandler::setFailedLoginError()
			can be used to specify an error to be thrown to the UserError service.
			This change is primarily so that people using different languages won't be locked
			into using English for this error message (a pretty important one).
		 (<i>Gabe Schine</i>)
		<li/> Change:  
			LoginState::attachData() has been moved to Harmoni::attachContextData() and
			LoginState::getData() has been moved to Context::getData() for logical and
			organizational reasons.
		 (<i>Gabe Schine</i>)
		<li/> Change:  LoginHandler and Harmoni: when LoginHandler is used, 
		the action that is checked for required authentication is now the LAST action
		executed instead of the first. This way, the action that finally ends up being
		executed is the "authoritative" action. (<i>Gabe Schine</i>)
	</ul><br/><h2>Version 0.0.3</h2><h3>2003-11-26</h3><ul>
