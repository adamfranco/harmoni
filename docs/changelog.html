		<li/> Change:  
			Authentication now plays nicely with GET parameters and maintains them
			around during the authentication sequence.
		 (<i>Adam Franco</i>)
		<li/> Change:  
			Agent searching works with new mapping system.
		 (<i>Adam Franco</i>)
	</ul><br/><h2>Version 0.3.0</h2><h3>2005-04-07</h3><ul>
		<li/> Change:  
			New Framework/Architecture-GUI/Theme interaction decouples the Harmoni
			object from the output system. The GUIManager and other OutputHandlers
			extend the OutputHandler abstract class and can be attached to Harmoni.
			A default 'BasicOutputHandler' is used when no other OutputHandler is
			specified.
		 (<i>Adam Franco</i>)
		<li/> Change:  
			Services::startService(), Services::stopService(), Services::restartService(), 
			and Services::startAll() are now deprecated and print warnings if used.
			Please use Services::startManagerAsService() and/or Services::getService() 
			instead.
		 (<i>Adam Franco</i>)
		<li/> Change:  
			'Service' classes no longer extend the services interface or use
			start()/stop() methods. These had been designed into Harmoni, but were
			never used and are now removed. start()/stop() methods will NOT be
			called during service starting/stopping.
		 (<i>Adam Franco</i>)
		<li/> Change:  
			OKI version 1 interfaces and implementations have been removed, saving
			2MB of files and cleaning up the source tree.
		 (<i>Adam Franco</i>)
		<li/> Change:  
			The hierarchy's Tree class, HierarchyManager/tree/Tree.class.php, now 
			caches its traversal results. (Savings: 93,529 calls to tree-&gt;_traverse(), 
			43 seconds execution time on a 500MHz PC in a 5000-node hierarchy)
		 (<i>Adam Franco</i>)
		<li/> New feature:  
			ValidatorRule objects can now be accessed via static
			XxxxxValidatorRule::getRule() methods, allowing the ValidatorRule classes
			to behave as Singletons and avoid the instantiation of tens of thousands
			of ValidatorRule objects.
		 (<i>Adam Franco</i>)
		<li/> New feature:  
			GUI Manager now complete. ThemeHandler and LayoutHandler have been
			removed.
		 (<i>Dobo Radichkov</i>)
		<li/> New feature:  
			GUI Manager saving functionality.
		 (<i>Nikitas Stamatopoulos</i>)
		<li/> New feature:  
			OsidManagers can now be started and configured by 
			Services::startManagerAsService(&quot;name&quot;, $context, $configuration);
		 (<i>Adam Franco</i>)
		<li/> New feature:  
			Service names can now have aliases.
		 (<i>Adam Franco</i>)
		<li/> Change:  
			Authentication is completely handled by the AuthenticationManager
			OSID implementation instead of the LoginHandler/AuthenticationHandler.
			The LoginHandler and AuthenticationHandler have been removed.
		 (<i>Adam Franco</i>)
		<li/> New feature:  
			New back-end for managing authentication tokens, agents, and the mappings
			between agents and authentication tokens. This is all contained within
			the core/oki2/agentmanagement/ directory.
		 (<i>Adam Franco</i>)
		<li/> Change:  
			DBHandler now provides methods for transaction handling. Applications
			can be coded to use transactions to ensure atomic writes. Databases
			that do not support transactions will simply ignore the calls. Nested
			transaction calls in MySQL are interperated so that only the outer 
			transaction is run allowing applications coded to use nested transactions
			to often operate on MySQL 4.0.11+.
		 (<i>Adam Franco</i>)
		<li/> New feature:  
			Now includes implementations of v2.0 of the O.K.I OSIDs.
		 (<i>Adam Franco</i>)
		<li/> New feature:  
			Now includes v2.0 of the O.K.I OSIDs.
		 (<i>Adam Franco</i>)
		<li/> Bug Fix:
	 
			AuthorizationManager now handles group membership.
		 (<i>Adam Franco</i>)
		<li/> Change:  
			AuthorizationManager now properly returns implicit AZ corresponding to
			explicit AZs at a parent instead of returning the explict AZs themselves.
		 (<i>Adam Franco</i>)
		<li/> Change:  
			DataManager: added function to SchemaManager to generate valid PHP code 
			for a given Schema.
		 (<i>Gabe Schine</i>)
		<li/> Change:  
			DataManager: deleting a value from a Record without version control now 
			actually deletes the value instead of flagging it as inactive.
		 (<i>Gabe Schine</i>)
		<li/> Change:  
			The LanguageLocalizer now defines functions for _() and gettext() that
			simply return the passed string, so that localized apps can fail
			gracefully to their native language if gettext is not installed.
		 (<i>Adam Franco</i>)
		<li/> Change:  
			DBHandler improvements: SQL strings are prettier now. Also added variable
			binding functionallity.
		 (<i>Dobo Radichkov</i>)
	</ul><br/><h2>Version 0.2.0</h2><h3>2004-10-26</h3><ul>
		<li/> New feature:  
			Added a &quot;MIME&quot; service for sniffing mime types from file extensions.
		 (<i>Adam Franco</i>)
		<li/> New feature:  
			Added an ImageProcessor service for the resizing of images, generation
			of thumbnails, and other common image processing functions. This service
			can be configured to use multiple modules to handle different file types,
			as availible. An example would be using PHP's GD libraries for handling
			jpegs and pngs, while using ImageMagick (via shell_exec()) for tiff,
			psd, pdf, etc. files.
		 (<i>Adam Franco</i>)
		<li/> Bug Fix:
	 
			DBHandler: PostgreSQL now functions without throwing invalid errors.
		 (<i>Adam Franco</i>)

		 (<i>Gabe Schine</i>)
		<li/> New feature:  
			Harmoni::executeLogin() executes the LoginHandler and stores the result to avoid discrepancies.
		 (<i>Gabe Schine</i>)
		<li/> Change:  
			Migrated OKI DR implementation to use new DataManager.
		 (<i>Gabe Schine</i>)
		<li/> Change:  
			DataManager: Records now dynamically update their fetch-mode (how much &amp; what data has been fetched) depending on the operation to be performed. Previous version required one to manually re-fetch records (annoying).
		 (<i>Gabe Schine</i>)
		<li/> New feature:  
			Function printDebugBacktrace([$traceArray]) will print out a debug_backtrace() in a pretty way.
		 (<i>Gabe Schine</i>)
		<li/> New feature:  
			DataManager: Record::getValuesArray() returns an associative array of all active values in a Record.
		 (<i>Gabe Schine</i>)
		<li/> New feature:  
			DateTime::toString() now has optional parameter to return a shorter M/D/Y for the date instead of Month DD, YYYY.
		 (<i>Gabe Schine</i>)
		<li/> Bug Fix:
	 
			AuthN queries now have slashes added to dbc query values.
		 (<i>Adam Franco</i>)
		<li/> Bug Fix:

			callback functions.
		 (<i>Adam Franco</i>)
		<li/> New feature:  
			A new &quot;Sets&quot; service provides an easy system for the creation, ordering,
			and maintaining of persistant collections of Ids.
		 (<i>Adam Franco</i>)
		<li/> New feature:  
			Added new system for storing primitive data values in objects (all classes implementing the Primitive interface - see harmoni/core/dataManager/primitives)
		 (<i>Gabe Schine</i>)
		<li/> New feature:  
			Re-worked the DataManager with simpler class names and more flexibility. (see harmoni/core/dataManager)
		 (<i>Gabe Schine</i>)
		<li/> New feature:  
			Added a &quot;revision&quot; to all DataSetTypeDefinitions for later program upgrades (can check revision number to see if the structure is up-to-date instead of comparing every field).
		 (<i>Gabe Schine</i>)
		<li/> New feature:  
			GUIManager service, based around CSS, will eventually replace the 
			theme/layout handlers.
		 (<i>Dobo Radichkov</i>)
		<li/> New feature:  
			Implemented the Authorization OSID.
		 (<i>Dobo Radichkov</i>)
		<li/> Change:  
			Reworked the Hierarchy implementation to use a better data-fetching/caching
			model.
		 (<i>Dobo Radichkov</i>)
	</ul><br/><h2>Version 0.1.0</h2><h3>2004-06-11</h3><ul>
		<li/> New feature:  
			Added a new OKI-Hiearchy implementation (hierarchy2).
		 (<i>Dobo Radichkov</i>)
		<li/> New feature:  
			DataManager: added a datatype to store OKI-style types.
		 (<i>Gabe Schine</i>)
		<li/> Bug Fix:
	 
			Bugs in LoginHandler.
		 (<i>Gabe Schine</i>)
		<li/> Change:  
			LanguageLocalizer reworked for easier usage and caching of language
			preferences.
		 (<i>Adam Franco</i>)
		<li/> Change:  
			The DataManager/metaData now uses the OKI Shared Ids instead of its own internal
			id system. This keeps all access to unique ids safely behind the Shared interface.
		 (<i>Adam Franco</i>)
		<li/> Change:  
			Themes and layouts have been completely re-worked to support easier use and
			more user control of the themes.
		 (<i>Adam Franco</i>)
		<li/> Change:  
			Argument Validator now dosn't fail on string representations of integers;
			i.e. &quot;100&quot; as well as 100 will validate.
		 (<i>Adam Franco</i>)
		<li/> New feature:  
			Implimented the Digital Repository OSID in Harmoni. The DR uses the Hierarchy OSID,
			the DataManager, and the Shared OSID to provide for high-level access and browsing
			of Assets and their associated data/metadata.
		 (<i>Adam Franco</i>)
		<li/> Change:  
			Services: The Harmoni Services now check for the Error Handler and use that
			to print out errors if it is availible. This makes for easier to read backtraces.
		 (<i>Adam Franco</i>)
		<li/> Change:  
			DBHandler: DBHandler now throws fatal errors with an explanation when a query
			fails.
		 (<i>Adam Franco</i>)
		<li/> New feature:  
			Hierarchy: Implimented the Hierarchy OSID. The Hiearchy supports the storing
			of multiple hierarchies and their nodes in one database. In the current 
			implimentation, the entire hierarchy is pulled from the database each load. This
			needs to be re-written to optimize it for fast reads from 100,000+ node
			hierarchy (current Segue at Middlebury has ~50,000 nodes).
		 (<i>Adam Franco</i>)
		<li/> New feature:  
			DataManager: added DataSet caching to the DataSetManager. Added support for required fields
			in DataSetTypeDefinitions.
		 (<i>Gabe Schine</i>)
		<li/> Change:  
			Removed argument validation from DateTime constructor to speed up code by 33%.
		 (<i>Gabe Schine</i>)
		<li/> Change:  
			DataManager: sped up fetching large numbers of DataSets at once (by a factor of two).
		 (<i>Gabe Schine</i>)
		<li/> Change:  
			DataManager: DataSet::prune() now takes a required VersionConstraint object on which to base the
			pruning process. Handling of pruning Tags is very very messy, but it works.
		 (<i>Gabe Schine</i>)
		<li/> New feature:  
			DataManager: can use DataSetManager::selectIDsBySearch() to search all/some DataSets and return
			a list of DataSets that match the criteria.
		 (<i>Gabe Schine</i>)
		<li/> Change:  
			DataManager: ValueVersion::prune() now deletes itself if the DataSet it is part of is inactive.
		 (<i>Gabe Schine</i>)
		<li/> Change:  
			DataManager: DataSet::prune() now removes all Tags associated with itself.
		 (<i>Gabe Schine</i>)
	</ul><br/><h2>Version 0.0.5</h2><h3>2004-01-09</h3><ul>
		<li/> Change:

			for ID creation.
		
		<li/> Bug Fix:
	 
			DateTime::toString() now correctly displays minutes.
		
		<li/> New feature:  
			Optional third argument to DataSetManager::fetchArrayOfIDs() specifies an array of DataSetTypes to limit the
			query.
		 (<i>Gabe Schine</i>)
		<li/> New feature:  
			Completed the HarmoniDataManager!
		 (<i>Gabe Schine</i>)
		<li/> Change:  
			HarmoniDataManager::setup($dbID) now takes optional second argument including a list of DataSetTypes to
			preload in a single query to save time and Database overhead.
		 (<i>Gabe Schine</i>)
		<li/> New feature:  
			added FloatDataType, ShortStringDataType. finished up DataManager tagging, cloning, pruning functionality.
		 (<i>Gabe Schine</i>)
		<li/> New feature:  
			added BooleanDataType to DataManager.
		 (<i>Gabe Schine</i>)
		<li/> New feature:  
			DataSetManager::fetchArrayOfIDs() fetches an array of DataSet ids in one SQL query. 
		 (<i>Gabe Schine</i>)
		<li/> New feature:  
			DateTime::compare(date1, date2) returns difference in seconds between two dates.
		 (<i>Gabe Schine</i>)
		<li/> Bug Fix:
	 
			Typo in constructor for UnknownDBError class.
		
		<li/> New feature:  
			Harmoni::forward(module,action) is now a synonym for Harmoni::ActionHandler::forward() for convenience.
		 (<i>Gabe Schine</i>)
		<li/> New feature:  
			Classes: Timer and QueryCounter for easy micro-second timing or DB query counting, respectively.
		 (<i>Gabe Schine</i>)
		<li/> Change:  
			Harmoni::getData has been deprecated and replaced by Harmoni::getAttachedData to avoid ambiguity.
		 (<i>Gabe Schine</i>)
		<li/> Change:  
			IDManager::newID() now uses auto_increment DB functionality to reduce query count on compatible
			servers.
		 (<i>Gabe Schine</i>)
		<li/> Bug Fix:
	 
			DataSet::populate() now sets its own ID to avoid super re-duplication of DataSets in database.
		 (<i>Gabe Schine</i>)
		<li/> Bug Fix:
	 
			DateTime::now() now gives correct Hour value. Likewise MySQLDatabase::toDBDate() now adds 1 to hour value
			to give correct 1-24 value. Other DB Types haven't yet been checked.
		 (<i>Gabe Schine</i>)
		<li/> Change:  
			Modified field in HarmoniDataManager table &quot;datasetfield&quot; from &quot;datasetfield_created&quot; to &quot;datasetfield_modified&quot;
			since it is updated on every commit().
		 (<i>Gabe Schine</i>)
		<li/> New feature:  
			Extensive work on DataManager. Now works for creating/retrieving datasets with version controls.
		 (<i>Gabe Schine</i>)
		<li/> Bug Fix:
	 
			Corrected ArgumentValidator call in DBHandler checking for DateTimeInterface instead of DateTime.
		 (<i>Gabe Schine</i>)
		<li/> New feature:  
			Added AgentInformationHandler::agentExists($name, [$method]) which steps through each AuthenticationMethod
			and checks for an existing agent.
		 (<i>Gabe Schine</i>)
		<li/> Change:  
			LoginState now has better support for Active/Authenticated agents. It should allow one to change
			the active agent without disturbing the actual authentication process.
		 (<i>Gabe Schine</i>)
	</ul><br/><h2>Version 0.0.4</h2><h3>2003-12-06</h3><ul>
		<li/> New feature:

			Harmoni::attachContextData() has been renamed (again) to Harmoni::attachData().
			Context::getData() has been moved to Harmoni::getData().
		 (<i>Gabe Schine</i>)
		<li/> Change:  
			Context object now carries an array holding the executed actions path, available
			by referencing Context::actionPath.
		 (<i>Gabe Schine</i>)
		<li/> Change:  
			ActionHander and Harmoni: ActionHandler now only passes a reference to the Harmoni
			object to action functions and scripts. Other variables are available here:

		 (<i>Gabe Schine</i>)
		<li/> Change:  
			Removed many .interface.php files to save on load times and unnecessary flexibility.
		 (<i>Gabe Schine</i>)
		<li/> Change:  
			LoginHandler no longer throws a default error on login failure. LoginHandler::setFailedLoginError()
			can be used to specify an error to be thrown to the UserError service.
			This change is primarily so that people using different languages won't be locked
			into using English for this error message (a pretty important one).
		 (<i>Gabe Schine</i>)
		<li/> Change:  
			LoginState::attachData() has been moved to Harmoni::attachContextData() and
			LoginState::getData() has been moved to Context::getData() for logical and
			organizational reasons.
		 (<i>Gabe Schine</i>)
		<li/> Change:  LoginHandler and Harmoni: when LoginHandler is used, 
		the action that is checked for required authentication is now the LAST action
		executed instead of the first. This way, the action that finally ends up being
		executed is the &quot;authoritative&quot; action. (<i>Gabe Schine</i>)
	</ul><br/><h2>Version 0.0.3</h2><h3>2003-11-26</h3><ul>
		<li/> Change:  Made ActionHandler check for class and method definitions before trying to execute them. (<i>Gabe Schine</i>)
		<li/> New feature:  Added defines in config/services.cfg.php to allow a choice of which major &quot;modules&quot; of Harmoni to load, in order to save on startup time. (<i>Gabe Schine</i>)

			additional arguments which are passed to the service class
			constructor.
		 (<i>Gabe Schine</i>)
		<li/> New feature:  
			FormFieldSet class under 'utilities' combines FieldSet functionality
			with keeping track of changed values and easy validation. Intended 
			for HTML Form use.

			Fully implimented the Hierarchy Service, the first of the OKI OSIDs
			to be implimented. The Hierarchy Service supports saving to a
			database as well as memory-only usage.
