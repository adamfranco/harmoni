<h1>Harmoni Change-Log</h1>
<h2>Version 0.12.1</h2>
<h3>2007-09-14</h3>
<ul>
		<li> Bug Fix:  
			Updating the MySQL Hierarchy and Scheduling table definitions to work with
			fixes in harmoni-0.12.0.
		 (<em>2007-09-14 - Adam Franco</em>)</li>
	</ul>
<br><h2>Version 0.12.0</h2>
<h3>2007-09-13</h3>
<ul>
		<li>
<span style="color: red">*** IMPORTANT ***</span> Change:  
			In order to support PostgreSQL without refactoring of the Database Handler,
			column names have been all made lowercase. To update a currently populated
			harmoni database to the new names, run the following updater script:
			harmoni/core/DBHandler/db_updater.php
		 (<em>2007-09-11 - Adam Franco</em>)</li>
		
		<li>
<span style="color: red">*** IMPORTANT ***</span> Change:  
			Hierarchy: The node relation and ancestory tables, j_node_node and node_ancestory
			were both missing a reference to the hierarchy for which the node id was valid.
			This could cause conflicts if node ids are repeated in separate hiearchies.
			Existing Harmoni databases will need to have these columns added and the data
			updated.
		 (<em>2007-09-13 - Adam Franco</em>)</li>
		
		<li>
<span style="color: red">*** IMPORTANT ***</span> Change:  
			Scheduling: Two sc_item columns "start" and "end" conflict with reserved
			words in PostgreSQL. Existing Harmoni databases will need to have these columns added and the data
			updated.
		 (<em>2007-09-13 - Adam Franco</em>)</li>
		
		<li> Change:  
			DBHandler: The PostGre classes have all been renamed to PostgreSQL
		 (<em>2007-09-14 - Adam Franco</em>)</li>
		
		<li> Bug Fix:  
			ErrorHandler: Fixed reliance on methods in the HarmoniException class
			when printing.
		 (<em>2007-09-13 - Adam Franco</em>)</li>
		<li> Bug Fix:  
			Fixed numerous MySQL-specific SQL statements that didn't work with PostgreSQL.
		 (<em>2007-09-13 - Adam Franco</em>)</li>
		<li> Bug Fix:  
			Added auto-increment-column designators to appropriate Insert Queries
			so that the sequence-values could be accessed when using PostgreSQL.
		 (<em>2007-09-13 - Adam Franco</em>)</li>
		<li> New feature:  
			DBHandler: Can now run an entire directory tree full of sql files.
		 (<em>2007-09-11 - Adam Franco</em>)</li>
		<li> Bug Fix:  
			DBHandler: Some fixes to the PostgreSQL implementation and tests.
		 (<em>2007-09-11 - Adam Franco</em>)</li>
		<li> New feature:  
			DBHandler: New database updater utility. The only function implemented currently
			is to convert column names to lowercase.
		 (<em>2007-09-11 - Adam Franco</em>)</li>
		<li> Bug Fix:  
			ErrorHandler: Fixed HTML syntax error in Exception printing.
		 (<em>2007-09-11 - Adam Franco</em>)</li>
		<li> Bug Fix:  
			Repository: Now properly escapes values in modification date-storing query.

<br><h2>Version 0.11.0</h2>
<h3>2007-09-07</h3>
<ul>
		<li>
<span style="color: red">*** IMPORTANT ***</span> Change:  
			As of this version, Harmoni no longer supports PHP4. Please use PHP5 or later.
		 (<em>Adam Franco</em>)</li>
		<li> Change:  
			GUI: Y-Layout now uses div tags instead of tables to allow the setting
			of child widths.
		 (<em>Adam Franco</em>)</li>
		<li> Change:  
			Removing ampersands for compatability with other PHP5 code.
			The BBEdit-grep string used for the find and replace was:
					(function )&amp;|(=\s?)&amp;([^a-z#])|([^&amp;])&amp;\s?(\$)
			replaced with
					\1\2\3\4\5
			
			Special Changes were made to the following files to fix problems introduced 
			in the search and repace for ampersands:
					- polyphony/main/library/ResultPrinter/ArrayResultPrinter.class.php - getLayout()
							- $item = $this-&gt;_array[key($this-&gt;_array)];
							======
							+ $item = current($this-&gt;_array);
					
					- harmoni/core/oki2/repository/HarmoniRecord.class.php - getParts()
							Moved the following line out of the if-statement:
							$activeValue = $allRecordFieldValues[$key]-&gt;getActiveVersion();
					
					- harmoni/core/oki2/hierarchy/tree/Tree.class.php - _traverse()
							Kept the first parameter being passed by reference. Needed in this case.

		 (<em>Gabe Schine</em>)</li>
		<li> Change:  
			Changed DBHandler's toDBDate functionality to automatically format and include

		 (<em>Niraj Dhungel</em>)</li>
		<li> Bug Fix:  
			The hierarchy cache had a problem where _isCached() was called as a property
			instead of a method, square brackets [] versus parenthasis (), and was breaking
			the cache by creating nodes that were listed as children of other nodes, but did
			not have their parents listed.
		 (<em>Adam Franco</em>)</li>
		<li> Change:  
			The Chronology Library as well as the dataManager primitives have now
			been moved to core/Primitives and generalized.
		 (<em>Adam Franco</em>)</li>
		<li> Change:  
			The Time and DateTime classes have been removed and their functionality
			replaced by the new Chronology DateAndTime class.
		 (<em>Adam Franco</em>)</li>
		<li> Change:  
			DataManager:
			
			Records no longer have an active state. They either exist or they don't.
			
			Fields that are deleted now are actually removed from the DB if the Record is
			not version controlled.
			
			getIndices() now returns only the active indices per default, including inactive
			ones only if requested.
		 (<em>Gabe Schine</em>)</li>
		<li> New feature:  
			Added a free() call to the SelectQueryResult classes to free
			memory used by the select query.
		 (<em>Gabe Schine</em>)</li>
		<li> New feature:  
			Added the chronology library, a PHP implemenation of the Squeak (Smalltalk) 
			Kernel-Chronology package and aims to serve as a general PHP 
			class-library for handling, comparing, and operating on chronological 
			objects. The original Smalltalk implementation is licensed under the 
			Squeak License http://squeak.org/download/license.html.
			
			This library includes classes that represent instants in time 
			(DateAndTime, TimeStamp), lengths of time (Duration), spans of time 
			anchored at certain instants (Timespan, Year, Month, Week, Date), as 
			well as recuring instants across a span of time (Schedule).
			
			This library has been designed to support all possible dates, times, and 
			durations, not just those since the UNIX epoch (1970). dates can have 
			positive years (C.E./A.D.) or negative years (B.C.E./B.C.) and Durations 
			have been tested to support lengths of time up to +/- 4 billion years with 
			second-precision. Beyond 4 billion years to the limit of testing (50 billion 
			years) Durations have hour-precision.
		 (<em>Adam Franco</em>)</li>
		<li> New feature:  
			Added URL-writing functionality as well as centralized processing
			of request-related variables from/to the browser into a family
			of classes related to the RequestHandler. 

			All 'communication' between the browser and the program is now
			abstracted and can be subsequently changed transparently.
		 (<em>Gabe Schine</em>)</li>
		<li> Change:  
			In order to allow for globally unique ids from the IdManager, the
			IdManager now allows for an Id prefix to place on ids. The prefix 
			'id.middlebury.edu-' would lead to ids simmilar to 
			'id.middlebury.edu-1234567890'. This will allow for multiple IdManagers
			to be used together without each giving out the same Id strings.
		 (<em>Adam Franco</em>)</li>
		<li> Change:  
			In conjunction with the IdManager's added 'prefix' capabilities,
			the Harmoni SQL table definitions have been updated to support the
			storing of string Ids (currently up to 75 characters) that may have
			originated from the IdManager. Ids generated internally by the database
			remain as integers.
		 (<em>Adam Franco</em>)</li>
		<li> Change:  
			In conjunction with the IdManager's added 'prefix' capabilities,
			the Harmoni services that store Ids have been upgraded to allow 
			string ids as well as integer ids.

<br><h2>Version 0.3.0</h2>
<h3>2005-04-07</h3>
<ul>
		<li> Change:  
			New Framework/Architecture-GUI/Theme interaction decouples the Harmoni

			extend the OutputHandler abstract class and can be attached to Harmoni.
			A default 'BasicOutputHandler' is used when no other OutputHandler is
			specified.
		 (<em>Adam Franco</em>)</li>
		<li> Change:  
			Services::startService(), Services::stopService(), Services::restartService(), 
			and Services::startAll() are now deprecated and print warnings if used.
			Please use Services::startManagerAsService() and/or Services::getService() 
			instead.
		 (<em>Adam Franco</em>)</li>
		<li> Change:  
			'Service' classes no longer extend the services interface or use
			start()/stop() methods. These had been designed into Harmoni, but were
			never used and are now removed. start()/stop() methods will NOT be
			called during service starting/stopping.
		 (<em>Adam Franco</em>)</li>
		<li> Change:  
			OKI version 1 interfaces and implementations have been removed, saving
			2MB of files and cleaning up the source tree.
		 (<em>Adam Franco</em>)</li>
		<li> Change:  
			The hierarchy's Tree class, HierarchyManager/tree/Tree.class.php, now 
			caches its traversal results. (Savings: 93,529 calls to tree-&gt;_traverse(), 
			43 seconds execution time on a 500MHz PC in a 5000-node hierarchy)
		 (<em>Adam Franco</em>)</li>
		<li> New feature:  
			ValidatorRule objects can now be accessed via static
			XxxxxValidatorRule::getRule() methods, allowing the ValidatorRule classes
			to behave as Singletons and avoid the instantiation of tens of thousands
			of ValidatorRule objects.
		 (<em>Adam Franco</em>)</li>

			The LoginHandler and AuthenticationHandler have been removed.
		 (<em>Adam Franco</em>)</li>
		<li> New feature:  
			New back-end for managing authentication tokens, agents, and the mappings
			between agents and authentication tokens. This is all contained within
			the core/oki2/agentmanagement/ directory.
		 (<em>Adam Franco</em>)</li>
		<li> Change:  
			DBHandler now provides methods for transaction handling. Applications
			can be coded to use transactions to ensure atomic writes. Databases
			that do not support transactions will simply ignore the calls. Nested
			transaction calls in MySQL are interperated so that only the outer 
			transaction is run allowing applications coded to use nested transactions
			to often operate on MySQL 4.0.11+.

		<li> Change:  
			AuthorizationManager now properly returns implicit AZ corresponding to

		<li> Change:  
			DataManager: added function to SchemaManager to generate valid PHP code 
			for a given Schema.
		 (<em>Gabe Schine</em>)</li>
		<li> Change:  
			DataManager: deleting a value from a Record without version control now 
			actually deletes the value instead of flagging it as inactive.
		 (<em>Gabe Schine</em>)</li>
		<li> Change:  
			The LanguageLocalizer now defines functions for _() and gettext() that
			simply return the passed string, so that localized apps can fail

		<li> New feature:  
			Added a "MIME" service for sniffing mime types from file extensions.
		 (<em>Adam Franco</em>)</li>
		<li> New feature:  
			Added an ImageProcessor service for the resizing of images, generation
			of thumbnails, and other common image processing functions. This service
			can be configured to use multiple modules to handle different file types,
			as availible. An example would be using PHP's GD libraries for handling
			jpegs and pngs, while using ImageMagick (via shell_exec()) for tiff,
			psd, pdf, etc. files.

		<li> Change:  
			Migrated OKI DR implementation to use new DataManager.
		 (<em>Gabe Schine</em>)</li>
		<li> Change:

		<li> Change:  
			LanguageLocalizer reworked for easier usage and caching of language
			preferences.
		 (<em>Adam Franco</em>)</li>
		<li> Change:  
			The DataManager/metaData now uses the OKI Shared Ids instead of its own internal
			id system. This keeps all access to unique ids safely behind the Shared interface.
		 (<em>Adam Franco</em>)</li>
		<li> Change:  
			Themes and layouts have been completely re-worked to support easier use and
			more user control of the themes.
		 (<em>Adam Franco</em>)</li>
		<li> Change:  
			Argument Validator now dosn't fail on string representations of integers;
			i.e. "100" as well as 100 will validate.
		 (<em>Adam Franco</em>)</li>
		<li> New feature:  
			Implimented the Digital Repository OSID in Harmoni. The DR uses the Hierarchy OSID,
			the DataManager, and the Shared OSID to provide for high-level access and browsing
			of Assets and their associated data/metadata.
		 (<em>Adam Franco</em>)</li>
		<li> Change:  
			Services: The Harmoni Services now check for the Error Handler and use that
			to print out errors if it is availible. This makes for easier to read backtraces.
		 (<em>Adam Franco</em>)</li>
		<li> Change:  
			DBHandler: DBHandler now throws fatal errors with an explanation when a query
			fails.
		 (<em>Adam Franco</em>)</li>
		<li> New feature:  
			Hierarchy: Implimented the Hierarchy OSID. The Hiearchy supports the storing
			of multiple hierarchies and their nodes in one database. In the current

			needs to be re-written to optimize it for fast reads from 100,000+ node
			hierarchy (current Segue at Middlebury has ~50,000 nodes).
