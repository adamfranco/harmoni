	<p>Packaged with Harmoni are a bunch of classes which should be useful to any internet PHP programmer. Some of these classes were written in order to be Harmoni Services, as described in previous chapters. This chapter concentrates on all the pre-defined services and how to use them. Remember, these services only represent a small part of Harmoni. To see the whole deal, take a look at the PHPDoc.</p>
