<changelog name="Harmoni ChangeLog">
	<version number="0.3.2" date="2005-04-12">
		<fix author='adam'>
			Existance of a try() function in the ErrorHandler was throwing parse
			errors on Win32 systems().
		</fix>
		<fix author='adam'>
			Services weren't starting because of case problems with the get_class()
			functions in PHP5.
		</fix>
	</version>
	<version number="0.3.1" date="2005-04-11">
		<change author='adam'>
			Authentication now plays nicely with GET parameters and maintains them
			around during the authentication sequence.
		</change>
		<change author='adam'>
			Agent searching works with new mapping system.
		</change>
	</version>
	<version number="0.3.0" date="2005-04-07">
		<change author='adam'>
			New Framework/Architecture-GUI/Theme interaction decouples the Harmoni
			object from the output system. The GUIManager and other OutputHandlers
			extend the OutputHandler abstract class and can be attached to Harmoni.
			A default 'BasicOutputHandler' is used when no other OutputHandler is
			specified.
		</change>
		<change author='adam'>
			Services::startService(), Services::stopService(), Services::restartService(), 
			and Services::startAll() are now deprecated and print warnings if used.
			Please use Services::startManagerAsService() and/or Services::getService() 
			instead.
		</change>
		<change author='adam'>
			'Service' classes no longer extend the services interface or use
			start()/stop() methods. These had been designed into Harmoni, but were
			never used and are now removed. start()/stop() methods will NOT be
			called during service starting/stopping.
		</change>
		<change author='adam'>
			OKI version 1 interfaces and implementations have been removed, saving
			2MB of files and cleaning up the source tree.
		</change>
		<change author='adam'>
			The hierarchy's Tree class, HierarchyManager/tree/Tree.class.php, now 
			caches its traversal results. (Savings: 93,529 calls to tree->_traverse(), 
			43 seconds execution time on a 500MHz PC in a 5000-node hierarchy)
		</change>
		<new author='adam'>
			ValidatorRule objects can now be accessed via static
			XxxxxValidatorRule::getRule() methods, allowing the ValidatorRule classes
			to behave as Singletons and avoid the instantiation of tens of thousands
			of ValidatorRule objects.
		</new>
		<new author='dobo'>
			GUI Manager now complete. ThemeHandler and LayoutHandler have been
			removed.
		</new>
		<new author='nik'>
			GUI Manager saving functionality.
		</new>
		<new author='adam'>
			OsidManagers can now be started and configured by 
			Services::startManagerAsService("name", $context, $configuration);
		</new>
		<new author='adam'>
			Service names can now have aliases.
		</new>
		<change author='adam'>
			Authentication is completely handled by the AuthenticationManager
			OSID implementation instead of the LoginHandler/AuthenticationHandler.
			The LoginHandler and AuthenticationHandler have been removed.
		</change>
		<new author='adam'>
			New back-end for managing authentication tokens, agents, and the mappings
			between agents and authentication tokens. This is all contained within
			the core/oki2/agentmanagement/ directory.
		</new>
		<change author='adam'>
			DBHandler now provides methods for transaction handling. Applications
			can be coded to use transactions to ensure atomic writes. Databases
			that do not support transactions will simply ignore the calls. Nested
			transaction calls in MySQL are interperated so that only the outer 
			transaction is run allowing applications coded to use nested transactions
			to often operate on MySQL 4.0.11+.
		</change>
		<new author='adam'>
			Now includes implementations of v2.0 of the O.K.I OSIDs.
		</new>
		<new author='adam'>
			Now includes v2.0 of the O.K.I OSIDs.
		</new>
		<fix author='adam'>
			AuthorizationManager now handles group membership.
		</fix>
		<change author='adam'>
			AuthorizationManager now properly returns implicit AZ corresponding to
			explicit AZs at a parent instead of returning the explict AZs themselves.
		</change>
		<change author='gabe'>
			DataManager: added function to SchemaManager to generate valid PHP code 
			for a given Schema.
		</change>
		<change author='gabe'>
			DataManager: deleting a value from a Record without version control now 
			actually deletes the value instead of flagging it as inactive.
		</change>
		<change author='adam'>
			The LanguageLocalizer now defines functions for _() and gettext() that
			simply return the passed string, so that localized apps can fail
			gracefully to their native language if gettext is not installed.
		</change>
		<change author='dobo'>
			DBHandler improvements: SQL strings are prettier now. Also added variable
			binding functionallity.
		</change>
	</version>
	<version number="0.2.0" date="2004-10-26">
		<new author='adam'>
			Added a "MIME" service for sniffing mime types from file extensions.
		</new>
		<new author='adam'>
			Added an ImageProcessor service for the resizing of images, generation
			of thumbnails, and other common image processing functions. This service
			can be configured to use multiple modules to handle different file types,
			as availible. An example would be using PHP's GD libraries for handling
			jpegs and pngs, while using ImageMagick (via shell_exec()) for tiff,
			psd, pdf, etc. files.
		</new>
		<fix author='adam'>
			DBHandler: PostgreSQL now functions without throwing invalid errors.
		</fix>
		<new author='adam'>

			Harmoni::addPostExecActions($action,...) adds a number of actions to execute after executing the action requested by the end user.
		</new>
		<new author='gabe'>
			Harmoni::executeLogin() executes the LoginHandler and stores the result to avoid discrepancies.
		</new>
		<change author='gabe'>
			Migrated OKI DR implementation to use new DataManager.
		</change>
		<change author='gabe'>
			DataManager: Records now dynamically update their fetch-mode (how much &amp; what data has been fetched) depending on the operation to be performed. Previous version required one to manually re-fetch records (annoying).
		</change>
		<new author='gabe'>
			Function printDebugBacktrace([$traceArray]) will print out a debug_backtrace() in a pretty way.
		</new>
		<new author='gabe'>
			DataManager: Record::getValuesArray() returns an associative array of all active values in a Record.
		</new>
		<new author='gabe'>
			DateTime::toString() now has optional parameter to return a shorter M/D/Y for the date instead of Month DD, YYYY.
		</new>

		</new>
		<new author='gabe'>
			Re-worked the DataManager with simpler class names and more flexibility. (see harmoni/core/dataManager)
		</new>
		<new author='gabe'>
			Added a "revision" to all DataSetTypeDefinitions for later program upgrades (can check revision number to see if the structure is up-to-date instead of comparing every field).
		</new>
		<new author='dobo'>
			GUIManager service, based around CSS, will eventually replace the 
			theme/layout handlers.
		</new>
		<new author='dobo'>
			Implemented the Authorization OSID.
		</new>
		<change author='dobo'>
			Reworked the Hierarchy implementation to use a better data-fetching/caching
			model.
		</change>
	</version>
	<version number="0.1.0" date="2004-06-11">
		<new author='dobo'>
			Added a new OKI-Hiearchy implementation (hierarchy2).
		</new>
		<new author='gabe'>
			DataManager: added a datatype to store OKI-style types.
		</new>
		<fix author='gabe'>
			Bugs in LoginHandler.
		</fix>
		<change author='adam'>
			LanguageLocalizer reworked for easier usage and caching of language
			preferences.
		</change>
		<change author='adam'>
			The DataManager/metaData now uses the OKI Shared Ids instead of its own internal
			id system. This keeps all access to unique ids safely behind the Shared interface.
		</change>
		<change author='adam'>
			Themes and layouts have been completely re-worked to support easier use and
			more user control of the themes.
		</change>
		<change author='adam'>
			Argument Validator now dosn't fail on string representations of integers;
			i.e. "100" as well as 100 will validate.
		</change>
		<new author='adam'>
			Implimented the Digital Repository OSID in Harmoni. The DR uses the Hierarchy OSID,
			the DataManager, and the Shared OSID to provide for high-level access and browsing
			of Assets and their associated data/metadata.
		</new>
		<change author='adam'>
			Services: The Harmoni Services now check for the Error Handler and use that
			to print out errors if it is availible. This makes for easier to read backtraces.
		</change>
		<change author='adam'>
			DBHandler: DBHandler now throws fatal errors with an explanation when a query
			fails.
		</change>
		<new author='adam'>
			Hierarchy: Implimented the Hierarchy OSID. The Hiearchy supports the storing
			of multiple hierarchies and their nodes in one database. In the current 
			implimentation, the entire hierarchy is pulled from the database each load. This
			needs to be re-written to optimize it for fast reads from 100,000+ node
			hierarchy (current Segue at Middlebury has ~50,000 nodes).
		</new>
		<new author='gabe'>
			DataManager: added DataSet caching to the DataSetManager. Added support for required fields
			in DataSetTypeDefinitions.
		</new>
		<change author='gabe'>
			Removed argument validation from DateTime constructor to speed up code by 33%.
		</change>
		<change author='gabe'>
			DataManager: sped up fetching large numbers of DataSets at once (by a factor of two).
		</change>
		<change author='gabe'>
			DataManager: DataSet::prune() now takes a required VersionConstraint object on which to base the
			pruning process. Handling of pruning Tags is very very messy, but it works.
		</change>
		<new author='gabe'>
			DataManager: can use DataSetManager::selectIDsBySearch() to search all/some DataSets and return
			a list of DataSets that match the criteria.
		</new>
		<change author='gabe'>
			DataManager: ValueVersion::prune() now deletes itself if the DataSet it is part of is inactive.
		</change>
		<change author='gabe'>
			DataManager: DataSet::prune() now removes all Tags associated with itself.
		</change>
	</version>
	<version number="0.0.5" date="2004-01-09">
		<change>
			Implementation of the OKI SharedManager (HarmoniSharedManager) now uses the HarmoniDataManager's IDManager
			for ID creation.
		</change>
		<fix>
			DateTime::toString() now correctly displays minutes.
		</fix>
		<new author='gabe'>
			Optional third argument to DataSetManager::fetchArrayOfIDs() specifies an array of DataSetTypes to limit the
			query.
		</new>
		<new author='gabe'>
			Completed the HarmoniDataManager!
		</new>
		<change author='gabe'>
			HarmoniDataManager::setup($dbID) now takes optional second argument including a list of DataSetTypes to
			preload in a single query to save time and Database overhead.
		</change>
		<new author='gabe'>
			added FloatDataType, ShortStringDataType. finished up DataManager tagging, cloning, pruning functionality.
		</new>
		<new author='gabe'>

		</new>
		<new author='gabe'>
			DateTime::compare(date1, date2) returns difference in seconds between two dates.
		</new>
		<fix>
			Typo in constructor for UnknownDBError class.
		</fix>
		<new author='gabe'>
			Harmoni::forward(module,action) is now a synonym for Harmoni::ActionHandler::forward() for convenience.
		</new>
		<new author='gabe'>
			Classes: Timer and QueryCounter for easy micro-second timing or DB query counting, respectively.
		</new>
		<change author='gabe'>
			Harmoni::getData has been deprecated and replaced by Harmoni::getAttachedData to avoid ambiguity.
		</change>
		<change author='gabe'>
			IDManager::newID() now uses auto_increment DB functionality to reduce query count on compatible
			servers.
		</change>
		<fix author='gabe'>
			DataSet::populate() now sets its own ID to avoid super re-duplication of DataSets in database.
		</fix>
		<fix author='gabe'>
			DateTime::now() now gives correct Hour value. Likewise MySQLDatabase::toDBDate() now adds 1 to hour value
			to give correct 1-24 value. Other DB Types haven't yet been checked.
		</fix>
		<change author='gabe'>
			Modified field in HarmoniDataManager table "datasetfield" from "datasetfield_created" to "datasetfield_modified"
			since it is updated on every commit().
		</change>
		<new author='gabe'>
			Extensive work on DataManager. Now works for creating/retrieving datasets with version controls.
		</new>
		<fix author='gabe'>
			Corrected ArgumentValidator call in DBHandler checking for DateTimeInterface instead of DateTime.
		</fix>
		<new author='gabe'>
			Added AgentInformationHandler::agentExists($name, [$method]) which steps through each AuthenticationMethod
			and checks for an existing agent.
		</new>
		<change author='gabe'>
			LoginState now has better support for Active/Authenticated agents. It should allow one to change
			the active agent without disturbing the actual authentication process.
		</change>
	</version>
	<version number="0.0.4" date="2003-12-06">
		<new author='gabe'>
			DateTime class has two new functions: toString() and toMDY() which display
			a full date/time and a MM/DD/YY string, respectfully.
		</new>
		<new author='gabe'>
			Harmoni::pathInfoParts now contains an array of PATH_INFO elements.
		</new>
		<new author='gabe'>
			ErrorHandler has new method getErrorQueue() which returns the error queue in a Queue object.
		</new>
		<change author='gabe'>
			Harmoni::attachContextData() has been renamed (again) to Harmoni::attachData().
			Context::getData() has been moved to Harmoni::getData().
		</change>
		<change author='gabe'>
			Context object now carries an array holding the executed actions path, available
			by referencing Context::actionPath.
		</change>
		<change author='gabe'>
			ActionHander and Harmoni: ActionHandler now only passes a reference to the Harmoni
			object to action functions and scripts. Other variables are available here:

		</change>
		<change author='gabe'>
			Removed many .interface.php files to save on load times and unnecessary flexibility.
		</change>
		<change author='gabe'>
			LoginHandler no longer throws a default error on login failure. LoginHandler::setFailedLoginError()
			can be used to specify an error to be thrown to the UserError service.
			This change is primarily so that people using different languages won't be locked
			into using English for this error message (a pretty important one).
		</change>
		<change author='gabe'>
			LoginState::attachData() has been moved to Harmoni::attachContextData() and
			LoginState::getData() has been moved to Context::getData() for logical and
			organizational reasons.
		</change>
		<change author='gabe'>LoginHandler and Harmoni: when LoginHandler is used, 
		the action that is checked for required authentication is now the LAST action
		executed instead of the first. This way, the action that finally ends up being
		executed is the "authoritative" action.</change>
	</version>
	<version number="0.0.3" date="2003-11-26">
		<change author='gabe'>Made ActionHandler check for class and method definitions before trying to execute them.</change>

			with keeping track of changed values and easy validation. Intended 
			for HTML Form use.
		</new>
		<change author='adam'> 
			Various fixes to the OSIDs. Added 'requires' for classes being
			extended. Fixed	syntax errors.
		</change>
		<new author='adam'>

			shared manager only provides for the generation of unique IDs using 
			a databse.
		</new>
		<new author='adam'>
			Fully implimented the Hierarchy Service, the first of the OKI OSIDs
			to be implimented. The Hierarchy Service supports saving to a
			database as well as memory-only usage.
		</new>
		<new author='gabe'>
			Harmoni Users's Guide stored locally in XML format. Wrote a
			gen-script in PHP using domxml to make pretty HTML interface.
		</new>
		<change author='gabe'>
			LanguageLocalizer now uses gettext() functions instead of
			home-brewed. Included PO generators, "borrowed" from the Horde
			project (www.horde.org).

		<change author='gabe'>New OKI interfaces, OKI gen-scripts and token
			files added (under harmoni/oki and harmoni/core/tools/oki
			respectively)
