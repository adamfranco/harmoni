v. 0.4.0 (2005-10-12)
----------------------------------------------------
		
	* Change: Groups and Agents are now stored in the hierarchy, allowing authorizations to be placed on them as qualifiers. This allows for specific authorizations as to who can modify which groups or users. (Adam Franco)
		
	* Change: Added a check for magic_quotes_gpc being Off in harmoni.inc.php. (Gabe Schine)
		
	* Bug Fix: Fixed all functions returning references to newly created objects in HarmoniAuthorizationManager. (Gabe Schine)

	* New feature: #102448 Implemented (but did not yet test) Oracle database connectivity. (Gabe Schine)
		
	* Change: Changed DBHandler's toDBDate functionality to automatically format and include quotations if necessary for the specific DB type. This became a problem for Oracle databases where a function call is necessary for date storage. (Gabe Schine)
		
	* New feature: Added getStringName() to the Database interface and added a method in the DBHandler to allows access to the string name based on the database index. (Gabe Schine)
		
	* Change: #116890 All DataManager database queries now free() their results after processing. (Gabe Schine)
		
	* New feature: GUIManager now allows for the setting of pre and post HTML. These are HTML tags that need to surround a compontent. This is primarily used to properly nest form-tags around tables/divs to generate valid XHTML. (Adam Franco)
		
	* Bug Fix: Repaired many PHP notices. (Adam Franco)
		
	* Bug Fix: Repaired many PHP notices. (Gabe Schine)
		
	* Bug Fix: Repaired many PHP notices. (Niraj Dhungel)
		
	* Bug Fix: The hierarchy cache had a problem where _isCached() was called as a property instead of a method, square brackets [] versus parenthasis (), and was breaking the cache by creating nodes that were listed as children of other nodes, but did not have their parents listed. (Adam Franco)
		
	* Change: The Chronology Library as well as the dataManager primitives have now been moved to core/Primitives and generalized. (Adam Franco)
		
	* Change: The Time and DateTime classes have been removed and their functionality replaced by the new Chronology DateAndTime class. (Adam Franco)
		
	* Change: DataManager: Records no longer have an active state. They either exist or they don't. Fields that are deleted now are actually removed from the DB if the Record is not version controlled. getIndices() now returns only the active indices per default, including inactive ones only if requested. (Gabe Schine)
		
	* New feature: Added a free() call to the SelectQueryResult classes to free memory used by the select query. (Gabe Schine)
		
	* New feature: Added the chronology library, a PHP implemenation of the Squeak (Smalltalk) Kernel-Chronology package and aims to serve as a general PHP class-library for handling, comparing, and operating on chronological objects. The original Smalltalk implementation is licensed under the Squeak License http://squeak.org/download/license.html. This library includes classes that represent instants in time (DateAndTime, TimeStamp), lengths of time (Duration), spans of time anchored at certain instants (Timespan, Year, Month, Week, Date), as well as recuring instants across a span of time (Schedule). This library has been designed to support all possible dates, times, and durations, not just those since the UNIX epoch (1970). dates can have positive years (C.E./A.D.) or negative years (B.C.E./B.C.) and Durations have been tested to support lengths of time up to +/- 4 billion years with second-precision. Beyond 4 billion years to the limit of testing (50 billion years) Durations have hour-precision. (Adam Franco)
		
	* New feature: Added URL-writing functionality as well as centralized processing of request-related variables from/to the browser into a family of classes related to the RequestHandler. All 'communication' between the browser and the program is now abstracted and can be subsequently changed transparently. (Gabe Schine)
		
	* Change: In order to allow for globally unique ids from the IdManager, the IdManager now allows for an Id prefix to place on ids. The prefix 'id.middlebury.edu-' would lead to ids simmilar to 'id.middlebury.edu-1234567890'. This will allow for multiple IdManagers to be used together without each giving out the same Id strings. (Adam Franco)
		
	* Change: In conjunction with the IdManager's added 'prefix' capabilities, the Harmoni SQL table definitions have been updated to support the storing of string Ids (currently up to 75 characters) that may have originated from the IdManager. Ids generated internally by the database remain as integers. (Adam Franco)
		
	* Change: In conjunction with the IdManager's added 'prefix' capabilities, the Harmoni services that store Ids have been upgraded to allow string ids as well as integer ids. (Adam Franco)
	
v. 0.3.3 (Never Released)

v. 0.3.1 (2005-04-11)
----------------------------------------------------
		
	* Change: Authentication now plays nicely with GET parameters and maintains them around during the authentication sequence. (Adam Franco)
		
	* Change: Agent searching works with new mapping system. (Adam Franco)
	
v. 0.3.0 (2005-04-07)
----------------------------------------------------
		
	* Change: New Framework/Architecture-GUI/Theme interaction decouples the Harmoni object from the output system. The GUIManager and other OutputHandlers extend the OutputHandler abstract class and can be attached to Harmoni. A default 'BasicOutputHandler' is used when no other OutputHandler is specified. (Adam Franco)
		
	* Change: Services::startService(), Services::stopService(), Services::restartService(), and Services::startAll() are now deprecated and print warnings if used. Please use Services::startManagerAsService() and/or Services::getService() instead. (Adam Franco)
		
	* Change: 'Service' classes no longer extend the services interface or use start()/stop() methods. These had been designed into Harmoni, but were never used and are now removed. start()/stop() methods will NOT be called during service starting/stopping. (Adam Franco)
		
	* Change: OKI version 1 interfaces and implementations have been removed, saving 2MB of files and cleaning up the source tree. (Adam Franco)
		
	* Change: The hierarchy's Tree class, HierarchyManager/tree/Tree.class.php, now caches its traversal results. (Savings: 93,529 calls to tree-&gt;_traverse(), 43 seconds execution time on a 500MHz PC in a 5000-node hierarchy) (Adam Franco)
		
	* New feature: ValidatorRule objects can now be accessed via static XxxxxValidatorRule::getRule() methods, allowing the ValidatorRule classes to behave as Singletons and avoid the instantiation of tens of thousands of ValidatorRule objects. (Adam Franco)
		
	* New feature: GUI Manager now complete. ThemeHandler and LayoutHandler have been removed. (Dobo Radichkov)
		
	* New feature: GUI Manager saving functionality. (Nikitas Stamatopoulos)

	* New feature: New back-end for managing authentication tokens, agents, and the mappings between agents and authentication tokens. This is all contained within the core/oki2/agentmanagement/ directory. (Adam Franco)
		
	* Change: DBHandler now provides methods for transaction handling. Applications can be coded to use transactions to ensure atomic writes. Databases that do not support transactions will simply ignore the calls. Nested transaction calls in MySQL are interperated so that only the outer transaction is run allowing applications coded to use nested transactions to often operate on MySQL 4.0.11+. (Adam Franco)
		
	* New feature: Now includes implementations of v2.0 of the O.K.I OSIDs. (Adam Franco)
		
	* New feature: Now includes v2.0 of the O.K.I OSIDs. (Adam Franco)
		
	* Bug Fix: AuthorizationManager now handles group membership. (Adam Franco)
		
	* Change: AuthorizationManager now properly returns implicit AZ corresponding to explicit AZs at a parent instead of returning the explict AZs themselves. (Adam Franco)
		
	* Change: DataManager: added function to SchemaManager to generate valid PHP code for a given Schema. (Gabe Schine)
		
	* Change: DataManager: deleting a value from a Record without version control now actually deletes the value instead of flagging it as inactive. (Gabe Schine)
		
	* Change: The LanguageLocalizer now defines functions for _() and gettext() that simply return the passed string, so that localized apps can fail gracefully to their native language if gettext is not installed. (Adam Franco)
		
	* Change: DBHandler improvements: SQL strings are prettier now. Also added variable binding functionallity. (Dobo Radichkov)
	
v. 0.2.0 (2004-10-26)
----------------------------------------------------
		
	* New feature: Added a "MIME" service for sniffing mime types from file extensions. (Adam Franco)
		
	* New feature: Added an ImageProcessor service for the resizing of images, generation of thumbnails, and other common image processing functions. This service can be configured to use multiple modules to handle different file types, as availible. An example would be using PHP's GD libraries for handling jpegs and pngs, while using ImageMagick (via shell_exec()) for tiff, psd, pdf, etc. files. (Adam Franco)
		
	* Bug Fix: DBHandler: PostgreSQL now functions without throwing invalid errors. (Adam Franco)
		
	* New feature: Digital Repository: Now has a "File" Info structure system for storing binary files. (Adam Franco)

	* Change: Migrated OKI DR implementation to use new DataManager. (Gabe Schine)
		
	* Change: DataManager: Records now dynamically update their fetch-mode (how much &amp; what data has been fetched) depending on the operation to be performed. Previous version required one to manually re-fetch records (annoying). (Gabe Schine)
		
	* New feature: Function printDebugBacktrace([$traceArray]) will print out a debug_backtrace() in a pretty way. (Gabe Schine)
		
	* New feature: DataManager: Record::getValuesArray() returns an associative array of all active values in a Record. (Gabe Schine)
		
	* New feature: DateTime::toString() now has optional parameter to return a shorter M/D/Y for the date instead of Month DD, YYYY. (Gabe Schine)
		
	* Bug Fix: #102455 AuthN queries now have slashes added to dbc query values. (Adam Franco)
		
	* Bug Fix: #102455 Shared queries now have slashes added to query values. (Adam Franco)
		
	* Bug Fix: #102455 Globally added addslashes() calls to quoted values in query strings. (Adam Franco)

	* New feature: Re-worked the DataManager with simpler class names and more flexibility. (see harmoni/core/dataManager) (Gabe Schine)
		
	* New feature: Added a "revision" to all DataSetTypeDefinitions for later program upgrades (can check revision number to see if the structure is up-to-date instead of comparing every field). (Gabe Schine)
		
	* New feature: GUIManager service, based around CSS, will eventually replace the theme/layout handlers. (Dobo Radichkov)
		
	* New feature: Implemented the Authorization OSID. (Dobo Radichkov)

v. 0.1.0 (2004-06-11)
----------------------------------------------------
		
	* New feature: Added a new OKI-Hiearchy implementation (hierarchy2). (Dobo Radichkov)
		
	* New feature: DataManager: added a datatype to store OKI-style types. (Gabe Schine)
		
	* Bug Fix: Bugs in LoginHandler. (Gabe Schine)
		
	* Change: LanguageLocalizer reworked for easier usage and caching of language preferences. (Adam Franco)
		
	* Change: The DataManager/metaData now uses the OKI Shared Ids instead of its own internal id system. This keeps all access to unique ids safely behind the Shared interface. (Adam Franco)
		
	* Change: Themes and layouts have been completely re-worked to support easier use and more user control of the themes. (Adam Franco)
		
	* Change: Argument Validator now dosn't fail on string representations of integers; i.e. "100" as well as 100 will validate. (Adam Franco)
		
	* New feature: Implimented the Digital Repository OSID in Harmoni. The DR uses the Hierarchy OSID, the DataManager, and the Shared OSID to provide for high-level access and browsing of Assets and their associated data/metadata. (Adam Franco)
		
	* Change: Services: The Harmoni Services now check for the Error Handler and use that to print out errors if it is availible. This makes for easier to read backtraces. (Adam Franco)
		
	* Change: DBHandler: DBHandler now throws fatal errors with an explanation when a query fails. (Adam Franco)
		
	* New feature: Hierarchy: Implimented the Hierarchy OSID. The Hiearchy supports the storing of multiple hierarchies and their nodes in one database. In the current implimentation, the entire hierarchy is pulled from the database each load. This needs to be re-written to optimize it for fast reads from 100,000+ node hierarchy (current Segue at Middlebury has ~50,000 nodes). (Adam Franco)
		
	* New feature: DataManager: added DataSet caching to the DataSetManager. Added support for required fields in DataSetTypeDefinitions. (Gabe Schine)
		
	* Change: Removed argument validation from DateTime constructor to speed up code by 33%. (Gabe Schine)
		
	* Change: DataManager: sped up fetching large numbers of DataSets at once (by a factor of two). (Gabe Schine)
		
	* Change: DataManager: DataSet::prune() now takes a required VersionConstraint object on which to base the pruning process. Handling of pruning Tags is very very messy, but it works. (Gabe Schine)
		
	* New feature: DataManager: can use DataSetManager::selectIDsBySearch() to search all/some DataSets and return a list of DataSets that match the criteria. (Gabe Schine)
		
	* Change: DataManager: ValueVersion::prune() now deletes itself if the DataSet it is part of is inactive. (Gabe Schine)
		
	* Change: DataManager: DataSet::prune() now removes all Tags associated with itself. (Gabe Schine)

	* New feature: Classes: Timer and QueryCounter for easy micro-second timing or DB query counting, respectively. (Gabe Schine)
		
	* Change: Harmoni::getData has been deprecated and replaced by Harmoni::getAttachedData to avoid ambiguity. (Gabe Schine)
		
	* Change: IDManager::newID() now uses auto_increment DB functionality to reduce query count on compatible servers. (Gabe Schine)
		
	* Bug Fix: DataSet::populate() now sets its own ID to avoid super re-duplication of DataSets in database. (Gabe Schine)
		
	* Bug Fix: DateTime::now() now gives correct Hour value. Likewise MySQLDatabase::toDBDate() now adds 1 to hour value to give correct 1-24 value. Other DB Types haven't yet been checked. (Gabe Schine)
		
	* Change: Modified field in HarmoniDataManager table "datasetfield" from "datasetfield_created" to "datasetfield_modified" since it is updated on every commit(). (Gabe Schine)
		
	* New feature: Extensive work on DataManager. Now works for creating/retrieving datasets with version controls. (Gabe Schine)
		
	* Bug Fix: Corrected ArgumentValidator call in DBHandler checking for DateTimeInterface instead of DateTime. (Gabe Schine)
		
	* New feature: Added AgentInformationHandler::agentExists($name, [$method]) which steps through each AuthenticationMethod and checks for an existing agent. (Gabe Schine)
		
	* Change: LoginState now has better support for Active/Authenticated agents. It should allow one to change the active agent without disturbing the actual authentication process. (Gabe Schine)
	
v. 0.0.4 (2003-12-06)
----------------------------------------------------
		
	* New feature: DateTime class has two new functions: toString() and toMDY() which display a full date/time and a MM/DD/YY string, respectfully. (Gabe Schine)

	* Change: ActionHander and Harmoni: ActionHandler now only passes a reference to the Harmoni object to action functions and scripts. Other variables are available here: Harmoni::HTTPVars, Harmoni::Context, Harmoni::LoginState. (Gabe Schine)
		
	* Change: Removed many .interface.php files to save on load times and unnecessary flexibility. (Gabe Schine)
		
	* Change: LoginHandler no longer throws a default error on login failure. LoginHandler::setFailedLoginError() can be used to specify an error to be thrown to the UserError service. This change is primarily so that people using different languages won't be locked into using English for this error message (a pretty important one). (Gabe Schine)
		
	* Change: LoginState::attachData() has been moved to Harmoni::attachContextData() and LoginState::getData() has been moved to Context::getData() for logical and organizational reasons. (Gabe Schine)
		
	* Change: LoginHandler and Harmoni: when LoginHandler is used, the action that is checked for required authentication is now the LAST action executed instead of the first. This way, the action that finally ends up being executed is the "authoritative" action. (Gabe Schine)

	* Change: Harmoni-&gt;execute() now returns the result from the action if outputHTML = false. (Gabe Schine)
		
	* Change: DebugHandlers now store an internal output level which is used when none is passed to the Printer. (Gabe Schine)
		
	* Change: LoginState now keeps track of both an Active and Logged-in agent. (Gabe Schine)
		
	* Change: Layouts &amp; other VisualComponents now have setLevel() and getLevel() methods and store the level locally. (Gabe Schine)
