Harmoni Change Log


v. 1.8.0 (2008-09-24)
----------------------------------------------------
This release adds support for IP-range-based group membership, user-preference
storage, and caching of group membership information.

New database tables must be installed for user-preferences.
		
		
	* New feature: #2102311 
		Agent: Now supports IP-range-based group membership.
		(2008-09-24 - Adam Franco)
		(reported by Bryan Carson of Middlebury College)
		
	* New feature: #2112775 
		UserData: New UserData system for storing persistent and per-session user
		preferences. 
		(2008-09-22 - Adam Franco)
		
	* Change: 
		AuthZ2: IsAuthorizedCache now saves the current user's group ids for the
		session to avoid unneeded groups membership searching. This doesn't change
		execution time too much, but does cut out between 17 and 18 queries or
		statement executions per execution cycle.
		(2008-09-24 - Adam Franco)
	



v. 1.7.0 (2008-08-27)
----------------------------------------------------
This release adds the ability to pass session information in the URLs to select
actions, enabling access to some actions by Flash and other clients that do not
reliably support cookies for all access.
		
		
	* New feature: #1820865 
		Harmoni now allows configuration of actions that allow the SESSION ID in URLs.
		
		If we are using an SID for an action configured to allow it in the url,
		the Set-Cookie header is overwritten with a bogus one to prevent session
		fixation. 
		(2008-08-26 - Adam Franco)
	



v. 1.6.2 (2008-08-25)
----------------------------------------------------
This release makes a few improvements to the Request system. See the change log for
details. 
		
		
	* Bug Fix: #2068136 
		Request: PathInfo URLs now do not include empty values as these will break
		the order of arguments on the receiver side since PHP converts
		double-slashes (//) to a single slash (/) in the PATH_INFO variable.
		(2008-08-22 - Adam Franco)
		
	* Change: 
		Request: UrlWriters now support moveValueToBeginning() method to re-order
		how parameters appear in the URLs.
		(2008-08-22 - Adam Franco)
		
	* Bug Fix: 
		Request: RequestContext->mkURLWithBase() now supports addition of
		request-tokens. 
		(2008-08-22 - Adam Franco)
	



v. 1.6.1 (2008-08-14)
----------------------------------------------------
Fixed a thumbnail generation bug.
		
		
	* Bug Fix: 
		ImageProcessor: Now uses the ImageMagick 'identify' command to determine if
		an image has one or more frames (such as a multi-page PDF). Only
		multi-framed images will have the first-frame identifier '[0]' used when
		generating thumbnails.
		(2008-08-14 - Adam Franco)
	



v. 1.6.0 (2008-08-14)
----------------------------------------------------
This release fixes a number of security issues.

Security issues fixed: 

- Cross-Site Request Forgeries (CSRF) are now eliminated from data-modification
actions. Read about CSRF at: http://shiflett.org/articles/cross-site-request-forgeries

- Harmoni can now be configured to use secure/http-only cookies. 

- Admin actions are now restricted to prevent listing of users and ids in the
system. 
		
		
	* New feature: #2040513 
		Security/Actions: Actions that involve data modification can now be
		configured to require per-usertokens in the request to prevent Cross-Site
		Request Forgeries.
		
		Actions can be added to the list by using $harmoni->ActionHandler->addRequestTokenRequiredActions().
		
		Once a module/action pair is added to the list, all URLs written to it
		will include the per-user token and that token will be checked before the
		action is allowed to execute.
		(2008-08-14 - Adam Franco)
		(reported by Josh Abraham of Rapid7, LLC.)
		
	* Bug Fix: #2040501 
		Security: Harmoni now supports setting the session.cookie_secure and
		session.cookie_httponly parameters in the harmoni config.
		(2008-08-14 - Adam Franco)
		(reported by Josh Abraham of Rapid7, LLC.)
	



v. 1.5.0 (2008-08-13)
----------------------------------------------------
This release makes several improvements to the Authorization, Repository, and
Request systems to support Segue 2. See the change log for details.
		
		
	* New feature: #1820937 
		Request: RequestContext now has a new mkUrlWithBase() method that allows the
		specification of a base-url to be used instead of the MYURL constant.
		(2008-08-07 - Adam Franco)
		
	* Change: 
		Repository: HarmoniRepository's getAssetsByType() method now first loads
		nodes by type to prevent lookups on all nodes. Cuts Segue 'All Visible'
		portal page loading from 65 seconds to 10 seconds.
		(2008-08-11 - Adam Franco)
		
	* Bug Fix: #2048119 
		AuthZ2: Session-caching of authorizations now works again.
		(2008-08-12 - Adam Franco)
		(reported by Gabe Schine)
		
	* Change: 
		AuthZ2: Authorization cache now expires after 10 minutes to prevent users
		with very old sessions from retaining abilities due to cached
		authorizations. 
		(2008-08-12 - Adam Franco)
	



v. 1.4.7 (2008-08-07)
----------------------------------------------------
This release fixes an authorization issue as well as enhances security by preventing
Javascript from being written to the logs. See the change log for details.
		
		
	* Bug Fix: 
		AuthZ2: A typo in the view authorization id was preventing cascading-up
		implicit view authorizations from ever being written.
		(2008-08-07 - Adam Franco)
		(reported by Peter Wilkins of MIT)
		
	* Bug Fix: #2040255 
		Logging: Log messages are now filtered to prevent Javascript insertion.
		(2008-08-05 - Adam Franco)
		(reported by Josh Abraham of Rapid7, LLC.)
		
	* Change: 
		ErrorHandler: New NoMoreIteratorElementsException available. 
		
		UnimplementedException now includes class and method name of the
		unimplemented method.
		(2008-08-04 - Adam Franco)
	



v. 1.4.6 (2008-08-01)
----------------------------------------------------
This release fixes a number of issues that were affecting Segue 2.

Most important is a fix to the image-processor to correctly support generation of
thumbnails from multi-page PDF files.
		
		
	* Bug Fix: #2031483 
		ImageProcessor: Thumbnail generation from multi-page PDFs now only extracts
		the first page enabling valid thumbnails to be generated and preventing
		extra processing of other pages that was being overwhelmed by very large
		PDFs. 
		(2008-07-29 - Adam Franco)
		(reported by Tom Coppeto of OnTapSolutions/O.K.I.)
		
	* Bug Fix: #2034986 
		Sets: Fixed up SQL keys to allow sets to contain an item several times at
		different positions as is allowed in the interface.
		(2008-08-01 - Adam Franco)
		
	* Bug Fix: 
		AuthZ2: Fixed up Hierarchy Exceptions to use valid Exception classes.
		(2008-07-25 - Adam Franco)
	



v. 1.4.5 (2008-07-24)
----------------------------------------------------
This release fixes a few minor issues that were causing problems with Segue.
		
		
	* Bug Fix: #2021574 
		Request: PathInfoRequest handler now replaces encoded question marks "%3F"
		with a "_quest_" placeholder to get around an issue with Apache's
		mod_rewrite accidentally decoding encoded question marks in some situations.
		(2008-07-23 - Adam Franco)
		
	* Bug Fix: 
		GUI2: Now forces the empty namespace for the theme id parameter to prevent
		the CSS from breaking when namespaces are not closed.
		(2008-07-22 - Adam Franco)
	



v. 1.4.4 (2008-07-21)
----------------------------------------------------
This release fixes an issue with Authorization settings for members of groups the
ids of which contain quotes.
		
		
	* Bug Fix: #2023672 
		AuthZ/PDO: Adding temporary work-around for bug 2023672/ PHP bug 41125
		
		A PHP/PDO bug is resulting in problems when escaped quotes exist in an
		SQL string that is then prepared. This is occurring for users who are
		members of groups that have a quote in their LDAP DN.
		
		This is the second time this bug has bitten us, this time in the AuthZ2
		AuthorizationCache. The first workaround was added to fix Harmoni bug 1970447.
		
		See:
		https://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=1970447&group_id=82171&atid=565234
		See: http://slug.middlebury.edu/~afranco/PHP_PDO_segfault/ See:
		http://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=41125 
		(2008-07-21 - Adam Franco)
		(reported by Hector Vila of Middlebury College)
	



v. 1.4.3 (2008-07-17)
----------------------------------------------------
This release fixes several issues with Themes and Logging.
		
		
	* Bug Fix: #2018232 
		GUI2: Output handler now sends theme options in the theme CSS URL.
		(2008-07-17 - Adam Franco)
		
	* Bug Fix: #2009090 
		Logging: Now returns an empty string if there is no backtrace.
		(2008-07-17 - Adam Franco)
	



v. 1.4.2 (2008-07-11)
----------------------------------------------------
This release includes a minor improvement to support Segue.
		
		
	* Change: 
		AuthZ2: More use of prepared statements in Authorization fetching methods to
		speed up Segue's 'roles' UI.
		(2008-07-11 - Adam Franco)
	



v. 1.4.1 (2008-07-10)
----------------------------------------------------
This release adds some minor improvements to support Segue.
		
		
	* New feature: 
		GUI2: GUIManager now can be configured to link to theme styles at a URL.
		(2008-06-18 - Adam Franco)
		
	* Change: 
		DatabaseManager: New NoSuchTableDatabaseException to classify missing table
		errors. Currently only supported by MySQL.
		(2008-07-08 - Adam Franco)
		
	* Bug Fix: 
		Agent: The Users group now includes all groups except itself and Everyone
		and all agents except Anonymous. This enables the Users group to be a
		stand-in for any user who has been authenticated.
		(2008-07-10 - Adam Franco)
	



v. 1.4.0 (2008-06-16)
----------------------------------------------------
This release includes two improvements:

* The ActionHandler now supports the specification of default parameters to be used
when the default module and action are used. * New methods for converting strings to
UTF-8 and converting 'smart-quotes'. Usage of this new String->makeUtf8() method
requires PHP to be compiled with the --enable-mbstring option.
		
		
	* New feature: #1995141 
		ActionHandler/HarmoniConfig: Can now specify default parameters along with
		the default module and action.
		(2008-06-16 - Adam Franco)
		
	* New feature: #1993889 
		Primitives: String and HtmlString now include a new method for converting
		non-UTF-8 characters to UTF-8: makeUtf8
		(2008-06-16 - Adam Franco)
	



v. 1.3.5 (2008-06-13)
----------------------------------------------------
Harmoni versions 1.2.0 through 1.3.4 included a bug in AuthZ2 in which implicit
authorizations were not created when new nodes were created with
Hierarchy->createNode(). This release fixes that issue.

For other improvements please see the change-log.
		
		
	* Bug Fix: #1991183 
		AuthZ2: Fixed AuthZ2 issue where implicit AZs were not being created for new nodes.
		
		This had the effect of causing Admins to not be authorized to view new
		Segue sites. Implicit AZs were created OK in other situations because nodes
		were attached to parents via the addParent() method which triggered implicit
		AZ insertion.
		(2008-06-12 - Adam Franco)
		
	* Change: 
		Request: Specifying null for a URL value will now remove the key rather than
		setting the value to an empty string.
		(2008-06-10 - Adam Franco)
		
	* New feature: 
		Logging: Can now return a list of existing categories.
		(2008-06-10 - Adam Franco)
		
	* Change: 
		AuthNMethods: Visitor registration system now logs registration and email
		confirmation steps.
		(2008-06-10 - Adam Franco)
		
	* Change: 
		AuthNMethods: Visitor registration email now informs the user that their
		username is their email address.
		(2008-06-10 - Adam Franco)
		
	* Bug Fix: 
		StatusStars: Now keeps the output buffers in the correct order.
		(2008-06-13 - Adam Franco)
	



v. 1.3.4 (2008-06-09)
----------------------------------------------------
This release adds support for a visitor registration authentication method.
		
		
	* New feature: #1820894 
		AuthNMethods: New Visitor Authentication method that allows for visitor
		registration. 
		(2008-06-05 - Adam Franco)
	



v. 1.3.3 (2008-06-03)
----------------------------------------------------
This release fixes a few issues that were affecting Concerto, most notably, several
issues with safe-mode restrictions when creating or extracting tar archives. 

Harmoni now includes a custom version of the Archive/Tar PEAR library with a fix
for bug #14058 that prevents proper extraction of archives with Safe Mode on.
		
		
	* Bug Fix: # 
		AuthZ: Fix to old authorization implementation that was causing function
		types to get messed up on installation of Concerto.
		(2008-06-02 - Adam Franco)
		
	* Change: #1912944 
		Archiving: Harmoni now includes a custom version of Archive/Tar with a fix
		for bug #14058 that was preventing decompression of tar files that have a
		directory hierarchy when in PHP 5.2+ with Safe Mode on.
		
		http://pear.php.net/bugs/bug.php?id=14058 
		(2008-06-03 - Adam Franco)
		
	* Change: # 
		Repository: Repository::getAssetsBySearch() now recognizes a null-type
		properties object.
		(2008-06-03 - Adam Franco)
	



v. 1.3.2 (2008-05-23)
----------------------------------------------------
This release fixes a few errors affected a few users, notably a work-around for a
PHP/PDO bug that results in segmentation faults when escaped quotes exist in an
SQLstring that is then prepared. This is occurring when checking authorization for
users who are members of groups that have a quote in their LDAP DN.
		
		
	* Bug Fix: #1970447 
		PDO: Adding temporary work-around for bug 1970447/ PHP bug 41125
		
		A PHP/PDO bug is resulting in problems when escaped quotes exist in an
		SQL string that is then prepared. This is occurring for users who are
		members of groups that have a quote in their LDAP DN.
		
		 See:
		https://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=1970447&group_id=82171&atid=565234
		See: http://slug.middlebury.edu/~afranco/PHP_PDO_segfault/ See:
		http://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=41125 
		(2008-05-23 - Adam Franco)
		
	* Bug Fix: # 
		Hierarchy: Fix to the older Hierarchy implementation to prevent errors when
		not using Harmoni_Db.
		(2008-05-22 - Adam Franco)
	



v. 1.3.1 (2008-05-22)
----------------------------------------------------
This release fixes a minor theming issue that was affecting the Polyphony
log-browsing actions.
		
		
	* Bug Fix: # 
		Gui2: Theme URLs now do not get messed up in names-spaced actions like
		log-browsing. 
		(2008-05-21 - Adam Franco)
	



v. 1.3.0 (2008-05-20)
----------------------------------------------------
This release adds support for a new Theming system, Gui2. Gui2 simplifies the
expectations of themes to allow a wider range of possible implementations and
storage techniques.

As well, a number of minor bugs have been fixed.
		
		
	* New feature: #1820834 
		Gui2: New Gui2 system re-envisions the way themes are defined and accessed.
		Rather than forcing themes to be concrete classes, a variety of theme
		sources can be defined that can each determine how their themes are stored
		and retrieved. 
		
		Themes may have options for varying their color scheme or other
		attributes, but this is an optional level of compliance, not forced.
		Similarly, themes may optionally support modification.
		(2008-05-14 - Adam Franco)
		
	* Change: # 
		Gui/Gui2: The EMPHASIZED_BLOCK has be deprecated and a SIDEBAR_BLOCK added
		to enable better syntactical alignment between usage and theme definition.
		(2008-05-20 - Adam Franco)
		
	* New feature: 
		Utilities/Filing: A simple Filing interface has been added to provide an
		abstraction on 'files'. These are currently used in the new Gui2 system to
		get and set Thumbnails and theme images.
		(2008-05-20 - Adam Franco)
		
	* Change: # 
		AuthNMethods: HttpAuth-token collector now can accept a user-function array
		instead of just a string.
		(2008-05-13 - Adam Franco)
		
	* Bug Fix: #1964729 
		Request: Multiple calls to startNamespace(null) were not filling the
		name-space stack with null name-spaces, so when endNamespace() was then
		called, extra non-null name-spaces were removed from the stack.
		(2008-05-20 - Adam Franco)
		(reported by Jeff Merriman of MIT)
		
	* Change: # 
		Request: Replacing slashes in path-info URLs.
		
		Apache denies requests where the path-info includes %2F, the encoded
		version of the forward slash, /. This is done to aid the security of CGI
		scripts, but means that we can't pass encoded slashes in PATH_INFO parameters.
		
		This fix replaces slashes with the string, '_slash_', when writing the
		path info urls and reverses that replacement on read.
		(2008-05-13 - Adam Franco)
		
	* Bug Fix: # 
		Primitives: Fixed static/non-static method access in Chronology.
		(2008-05-13 - Adam Franco)
		
	* Bug Fix: # 
		Primitives: Adding in a pass by reference to fix an Chronology bug.
		
		The _normalize() method needed an array passed by reference to act on. In
		the PHP 5 migration the reference got deleted by accident, so the
		normalization wasn't being done. This had the effect of not rolling over
		days when adding durations that bumped a date and time over the length of a
		day. 
		(2008-05-14 - Adam Franco)
	



v. 1.2.0 (2008-05-05)
----------------------------------------------------
This release includes a new implementation of the Authorization and Hierarchy
services along side of the original implementations. This new 'AuthZ2'
implementation stores hierarchy and authorization data in a set of tables with
foreign-key constraints/triggers to manage the removal of authorizations when nodes
in the hierarchy are dropped. As well, AuthZ2 stores implicit authorizations as rows
in an implicit_azs table to allow simple lookups without the need of traversing the
hierarchy at read-time. AuthZ2 enables Segue to run approximately 600% faster, with
some operations seeing 2000% decreases in execution time.

Additional improvements in this release include more robust Harmoni_Db support, as
well as fixes to Tagging, Language, and Database services.
		
		
	* New feature: #1951075 
		AuthZ2: New Authorization/Hierarchy package stores implicit authorizations
		as rows in their own table so that they can be quickly read at the expense
		of a small increase in writing time and storage space.
		
		Either AuthZ2 or the original Authorization and Hierarchy implementations
		can be used by Harmoni applications as these implementations are independent
		of one another. A migration script for moving hierarchy and authorization
		information out of The original tables and into the AuthZ2 tables can be
		found at harmoni/core/oki2/AuthZ2/migration.php
		
		Please note that in AuthZ2 the 'edu.middlebury.authorization.view'
		function has the property of cascading up the hierarchy as well as down.
		This property is needed by our Segue and Concerto applications and the lack
		of it in the original implementations required the use of the
		isAuthorizedBelow() function. All other authorization functions cascade down
		only. 
		(2008-04-24 - Adam Franco)
		
	* New feature: 
		AuthorizationManager: Now can be configured to use Harmoni_Db.
		(2008-04-18 - Adam Franco)
		
	* Change: 
		Authorization: Cleaned up query syntax to do use addWhereEqual(),
		addWhereLike(), etc methods rather than manually building WHERE strings.
		(2008-04-21 - Adam Franco)
		
	* Bug Fix: 
		Authorization: Now explicit AZs do not create identical duplicate implicit
		AZs when searching for AZs for any agent.
		(2008-04-24 - Adam Franco)
		
	* Change: 
		Authorization: Added AuthorizationManager::getIsAuthorizedCache() method to
		access the IsAuthorizedCache used by the current AuthorizationManager for
		queueing of qualifier-ids. This new method and its usage by the Repository
		and Authentication systems allows swapping of the Authorization-Hierarchy
		implementation. 
		(2008-04-21 - Adam Franco)
		
	* Change: 
		Authorization/Hierarchy: Now relying on type-hinting for validation of
		object parameters rather than using the ArgumentValidator.
		(2008-04-21 - Adam Franco)
		
	* Change: 
		Hierarchy: Cleaned up query syntax to do use addWhereEqual(),
		addWhereLike(), etc methods rather than manually building WHERE strings.
		(2008-04-21 - Adam Franco)
		
	* New feature: 
		IdManager: Now can be configured to use Harmoni_Db.
		(2008-04-18 - Adam Franco)
		
	* Bug Fix: 
		Harmoni_Db: Insert now ensures that at least one row of values exists.
		(2008-04-18 - Adam Franco)
		
	* Bug Fix: 
		Harmoni_Db: Can now set Auto-Increment table/key for retrieving the last
		insert id from INSERT query executions.
		(2008-04-24 - Adam Franco)
		
	* Bug Fix: # 
		Harmoni_Db: Backtrace collection now works when preparing queries directly
		as well as from query-building objects.
		(2008-04-25 - Adam Franco)
		
	* Change: # 
		Harmoni_Db: It seems that only the MySQL PDO adapter supports buffered
		queries, so result buffering is now done in PHP in Harmoni_Db rather than in
		the adapter. Hopefully performance won't take too much of a hit and
		portability will be preserved.
		(2008-04-29 - Adam Franco)
		
	* Bug Fix: # 
		Harmoni_Db: New Harmoni_Db query result class for INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE queries.
		
		Harmoni_Db_SelectResult is now only for SELECT results. Other modes of
		operation for INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE queries have been moved to a new
		class, Harmoni_Db_InUpDeResult.
		(2008-05-01 - Adam Franco)
		
	* Bug Fix: 
		DatabaseManager: InsertQueries will now convert numeric parameters to
		strings rather than throwing InvalidArgumentExceptions.
		(2008-04-18 - Adam Franco)
		
	* Change: # 
		DatabaseManager: Now sends null instead of NULL for auto-increment columns
		for better compatibility.
		(2008-04-25 - Adam Franco)
		
	* Bug Fix: # 
		DatabaseManager: Fix to transaction exception class name.
		(2008-04-28 - Adam Franco)
		
	* New feature: 
		ErrorHandler: Exceptions can now define a getHtmlMessage() method and have
		this HTML-formatted message printed without entity conversion.
		(2008-04-18 - Adam Franco)
		
	* Change: 
		Harmoni_DOMDocument: Now defines getHtmlMessage() in its ValidationException
		to print more legible messages.
		(2008-04-18 - Adam Franco)
		
	* New feature: #1940489 
		Tagging: Can now access information about individual applications of a tag
		via TagManager::getTagInfoForItem().
		(2008-04-18 - Adam Franco)
		
	* Change: #1940489 
		Tagging: Can now specify a time-stamp when setting a tag for a particular
		agent. 
		(2008-04-18 - Adam Franco)
		
	* Bug Fix: # 
		Language: Since putenv() is restricted in safe-mode, errors are now
		suppressed when calling it with safe-mode on as it is not needed in many
		systems. 
		(2008-05-01 - Adam Franco)
	



v. 1.1.0 (2008-04-11)
----------------------------------------------------
This release adds a new database access and SQL query system, Harmoni_Db. Harmoni_Db
is an extension of Zend_Db and adds Harmoni query-building syntax to the Zend_Db
system. Through Harmoni_Db, prepared SQL statements are now supported and can be
configured for use in the Hierarchy and AgentManagement services for increased performance.

See the change log for additional fixes and improvements.
		
		
	* New feature: #1814119 
		Harmoni_Db: New Zend_Db and PDO-based database abstraction and query writing system.
		
		See the following page for more information:

		(2008-04-03 - Adam Franco)
		
	* New feature: #1814119 
		Harmoni_Db: Required Zend_Db sources are now included with Harmoni. No extra
		installation is needed.
		(2008-04-03 - Adam Franco)
		
	* Change: 
		DatabaseManager: Can now trace query-calling functions.
		(2008-04-04 - Adam Franco)
		
	* New feature: #1814119 
		Hierarchy: Can now optionally use Harmoni_Db for some common queries.
		(2008-04-08 - Adam Franco)
		
	* Change: 
		Hierarchy: Now only catches UnknownIdExceptions to allow database exceptions
		to bubble up.
		(2008-04-08 - Adam Franco)
		
	* New feature: #1814119 
		AgentManagement: Can now optionally use Harmoni_Db for some common queries.
		(2008-04-08 - Adam Franco)
		
	* Bug Fix: #1934661 
		AgentManagement: LDAP search cache now is per baseDN.
		(2008-04-04 - Alex Chapin, Adam Franco)
		
	* Change: 
		Debug: added var_dump_pre() function for doing a var_dump() with pre-format
		tags. 
		(2008-04-08 - Adam Franco)
		
	* Bug Fix: 
		ErrorHandler: now prints the full file path in the backtrace file title.
		(2008-04-03 - Adam Franco)		
		
	* Bug Fix: #1938748 
		ErrorHandler: Now filters request values whose names contain 'password' and

		getExplicitAZs() as per the OSID.
		(2007-11-05 - Adam Franco)
		
	* Bug Fix: #1824880 
		Agent: The OSID Agent implementation now supports the addition of externally
		defined groups (such as from LDAP) as subgroups under locally defined
		groups. This allows for locally defined amalgamations of externally defined
		groups into one entity.
		
		This relationship is stored outside of the hierarchy in a new database
		table and requires a database update.
		(2007-11-07 - Adam Franco)
		
	**** IMPORTANT *** Change:

		caught separately from generic errors.
		(2007-10-05 - Adam Franco)
		
	* Change: 
		AuthZ: The Authorization caching system now searches for and verifies the
		existence of qualifier Ids passed to it. It caches a list of unknown ids and

		for qualifiers it will never match, such as those in non-HarmoniRepository
		Repository implementations.
		(2007-10-05 - Adam Franco)

----------------------------------------------------

		
	**** IMPORTANT *** Change:

		harmoni database to the new names, run the following updater script:
		harmoni/core/DBHandler/db_updater.php 
		(2007-09-11 - Adam Franco)
		
		
	**** IMPORTANT *** Change: 
		Hierarchy: The node relation and ancestry tables, j_node_node and
		node_ancestry were both missing a reference to the hierarchy for which the

		separate hierarchies. Existing Harmoni databases will need to have these
		columns added and the data updated.
		(2007-09-13 - Adam Franco)
		
		
	**** IMPORTANT *** Change:

		replaced with
		
		\1\2\3\4\5
		
		
		
		Special Changes were made to the following files to
		fix problems introduced in the search and replace for ampersands:

		- $item = $this->_array[key($this->_array)];
		
		======
		
		+ $item = current($this->_array);
		
		harmoni/core/oki2/repository/HarmoniRecord.class.php - getParts()
		
		- Moved the following line out of the if-statement:
		
		- $activeValue = $allRecordFieldValues[$key]->getActiveVersion();
		
		harmoni/core/oki2/hierarchy/tree/Tree.class.php - _traverse()

		moved to core/Primitives and generalized.
		(Adam Franco)
		
	* Change: 
		The Time and DateTime classes have been removed and their functionality
		replaced by the new Chronology DateAndTime class.
		(Adam Franco)
		
	* Change: 
		DataManager: no longer have an active state. They either exist or they don't.
		
		Fields that are deleted now are actually removed from the DB if the
		Record is not version controlled.
		
		getIndices() now returns only the active indices per default, including
		inactive ones only if requested.
		(Gabe Schine)
		
	* New feature: 
		Added a free() call to the SelectQueryResult classes to free memory used by
		the select query.
		(Gabe Schine)
		
	* New feature: 
		Added the chronology library, a PHP implementation of the Squeak (Smalltalk)
		Kernel-Chronology package and aims to serve as a general PHP class-library
		for handling, comparing, and operating on chronological objects. The
		original Smalltalk implementation is licensed under the Squeak License http://squeak.org/download/license.html.
		
		This library includes classes that represent instants in time
		(DateAndTime, TimeStamp), lengths of time (Duration), spans of time anchored
		at certain instants (Timespan, Year, Month, Week, Date), as well as
		recurring instants across a span of time (Schedule).
		
		This library has been designed to support all possible dates, times, and
		durations, not just those since the UNIX epoch (1970). dates can have
		positive years (C.E./A.D.) or negative years (B.C.E./B.C.) and Durations
		have been tested to support lengths of time up to +/- 4 billion years with
		second-precision. Beyond 4 billion years to the limit of testing (50 billion
		years) Durations have hour-precision.
		(Adam Franco)
		
	* New feature: 
		Added URL-writing functionality as well as centralized processing of
		request-related variables from/to the browser into a family of classes
		related to the RequestHandler. 
		
		All 'communication' between the browser and the program is now abstracted
		and can be subsequently changed transparently.
		(Gabe Schine)
		
	* Change: 
		In order to allow for globally unique ids from the IdManager, the IdManager
		now allows for an Id prefix to place on ids. The prefix 'id.middlebury.edu-'
		would lead to ids similar to 'id.middlebury.edu-1234567890'. This will allow
		for multiple IdManagers to be used together without each giving out the same
		Id strings.
		(Adam Franco)
		
	* Change: 
		In conjunction with the IdManager's added 'prefix' capabilities, the Harmoni
		SQL table definitions have been updated to support the storing of string Ids
		(currently up to 75 characters) that may have originated from the IdManager.
		Ids generated internally by the database remain as integers.
		(Adam Franco)
		
	* Change: 
		In conjunction with the IdManager's added 'prefix' capabilities, the Harmoni
		services that store Ids have been upgraded to allow string ids as well as
		integer ids.
		(Adam Franco)

		PHP5. 
		(Adam Franco)
		
	* Bug Fix: 
		Services weren't starting because of case problems with the get_class()
		functions in PHP5.
		(Adam Franco)
		
	* Bug Fix: 
		clone() is a reserved word in PHP5. All clone methods have been renamed
		replicate(). 
		(Adam Franco)

		(Adam Franco)
		
	**** IMPORTANT *** Change: 
		Harmoni now runs on PHP5 and on Win32 systems in addition to PHP4.3 and
		POSIX systems.
		(Adam Franco)

----------------------------------------------------

		
	* Change: 
		Authentication now plays nicely with GET parameters and maintains them
		around during the authentication sequence.
		(Adam Franco)
		
	* Change: 
		Agent searching works with new mapping system.
		(Adam Franco)
	



v. 0.3.0 (2005-04-07)
----------------------------------------------------

		
	* Change: 
		New Framework/Architecture-GUI/Theme interaction decouples the Harmoni
		object from the output system. The GUIManager and other OutputHandlers
		extend the OutputHandler abstract class and can be attached to Harmoni. A
		default 'BasicOutputHandler' is used when no other OutputHandler is
		specified. 
		(Adam Franco)
		
	* Change: 
		Services::startService(), Services::stopService(),
		Services::restartService(), and Services::startAll() are now deprecated and
		print warnings if used. Please use Services::startManagerAsService() and/or
		Services::getService() instead.
		(Adam Franco)
		
	* Change: 
		'Service' classes no longer extend the services interface or use
		start()/stop() methods. These had been designed into Harmoni, but were never
		used and are now removed. start()/stop() methods will NOT be called during
		service starting/stopping.
		(Adam Franco)
		
	* Change: 
		OKI version 1 interfaces and implementations have been removed, saving 2MB
		of files and cleaning up the source tree.
		(Adam Franco)
		
	* Change: 
		The hierarchy's Tree class, HierarchyManager/tree/Tree.class.php, now caches
		its traversal results. (Savings: 93,529 calls to tree->_traverse(), 43
		seconds execution time on a 500MHz PC in a 5000-node hierarchy)
		(Adam Franco)
		
	* New feature: 
		ValidatorRule objects can now be accessed via static
		XxxxxValidatorRule::getRule() methods, allowing the ValidatorRule classes to
		behave as Singletons and avoid the instantiation of tens of thousands of
		ValidatorRule objects.
		(Adam Franco)
		
	* New feature: 
		GUI Manager now complete. ThemeHandler and LayoutHandler have been removed.
		(Dobo Radichkov)
		
	* New feature:

		(Nikitas Stamatopoulos)
		
	* New feature: 
		OsidManagers can now be started and configured by
		Services::startManagerAsService("name", $context, $configuration);
		(Adam Franco)
		
	* New feature: 
		Service names can now have aliases.
		(Adam Franco)
		
	* Change: 
		Authentication is completely handled by the AuthenticationManager OSID
		implementation instead of the LoginHandler/AuthenticationHandler. The
		LoginHandler and AuthenticationHandler have been removed.
		(Adam Franco)
		
	* New feature: 
		New back-end for managing authentication tokens, agents, and the mappings
		between agents and authentication tokens. This is all contained within the
		core/oki2/agentmanagement/ directory.
		(Adam Franco)
		
	* Change: 
		DBHandler now provides methods for transaction handling. Applications can be
		coded to use transactions to ensure atomic writes. Databases that do not
		support transactions will simply ignore the calls. Nested transaction calls
		in MySQL are interpreted so that only the outer transaction is run allowing
		applications coded to use nested transactions to often operate on MySQL
		4.0.11+. 
		(Adam Franco)
		
	* New feature: 
		Now includes implementations of v2.0 of the O.K.I OSIDs.
		(Adam Franco)
		
	* New feature: 
		Now includes v2.0 of the O.K.I OSIDs.
		(Adam Franco)
		
	* Bug Fix: 
		AuthorizationManager now handles group membership.
		(Adam Franco)
		
	* Change: 
		AuthorizationManager now properly returns implicit AZ corresponding to
		explicit AZs at a parent instead of returning the explicit AZs themselves.
		(Adam Franco)
		
	* Change: 
		DataManager: added function to SchemaManager to generate valid PHP code for
		a given Schema.
		(Gabe Schine)
		
	* Change: 
		DataManager: deleting a value from a Record without version control now
		actually deletes the value instead of flagging it as inactive.
		(Gabe Schine)
		
	* Change: 
		The LanguageLocalizer now defines functions for _() and gettext() that
		simply return the passed string, so that localized apps can fail gracefully
		to their native language if gettext is not installed.
		(Adam Franco)
		
	* Change: 
		DBHandler improvements: SQL strings are prettier now. Also added variable
		binding functionality.
		(Dobo Radichkov)
	



v. 0.2.0 (2004-10-26)
----------------------------------------------------

		
	* New feature: 
		Added a "MIME" service for sniffing mime types from file extensions.
		(Adam Franco)
		
	* New feature: 
		Added an ImageProcessor service for the resizing of images, generation of
		thumbnails, and other common image processing functions. This service can be
		configured to use multiple modules to handle different file types, as
		available. An example would be using PHP's GD libraries for handling jpegs
		and pngs, while using ImageMagick (via shell_exec()) for tiff, psd, pdf,
		etc. files.
		(Adam Franco)
		
	* Bug Fix: 
		DBHandler: PostgreSQL now functions without throwing invalid errors.
		(Adam Franco)

		Harmoni::executeLogin() executes the LoginHandler and stores the result to
		avoid discrepancies.
		(Gabe Schine)
		
	* Change: 
		Migrated OKI DR implementation to use new DataManager.
		(Gabe Schine)
		
	* Change: 
		DataManager: Records now dynamically update their fetch-mode (how much &
		what data has been fetched) depending on the operation to be performed.
		Previous version required one to manually re-fetch records (annoying).
		(Gabe Schine)
		
	* New feature: 
		Function printDebugBacktrace([$traceArray]) will print out a
		debug_backtrace() in a pretty way.
		(Gabe Schine)
		
	* New feature: 
		DataManager: Record::getValuesArray() returns an associative array of all
		active values in a Record.
		(Gabe Schine)
		
	* New feature: 
		DateTime::toString() now has optional parameter to return a shorter M/D/Y
		for the date instead of Month DD, YYYY.
		(Gabe Schine)
		
	* Bug Fix: #102455 
		AuthN queries now have slashes added to dbc query values.
		(Adam Franco)
		
	* Bug Fix: #102455

		(Adam Franco)
		
	* New feature: 
		A new "Sets" service provides an easy system for the creation, ordering, and
		maintaining of persistent collections of Ids.
		(Adam Franco)
		
	* New feature: 
		Added new system for storing primitive data values in objects (all classes
		implementing the Primitive interface - see
		harmoni/core/dataManager/primitives) 
		(Gabe Schine)
		
	* New feature: 
		Re-worked the DataManager with simpler class names and more flexibility.
		(see harmoni/core/dataManager)
		(Gabe Schine)
		
	* New feature: 
		Added a "revision" to all DataSetTypeDefinitions for later program upgrades
		(can check revision number to see if the structure is up-to-date instead of
		comparing every field).
		(Gabe Schine)
		
	* New feature: 
		GUIManager service, based around CSS, will eventually replace the
		theme/layout handlers.
		(Dobo Radichkov)
		
	* New feature: 
		Implemented the Authorization OSID.
		(Dobo Radichkov)
		
	* Change: 
		Reworked the Hierarchy implementation to use a better data-fetching/caching
		model. 
		(Dobo Radichkov)
	



v. 0.1.0 (2004-06-11)
----------------------------------------------------

		
	* New feature: 
		Added a new OKI-Hierarchy implementation (hierarchy2).
		(Dobo Radichkov)
		
	* New feature: 
		DataManager: added a data type to store OKI-style types.
		(Gabe Schine)
		
	* Bug Fix: 
		Bugs in LoginHandler.
		(Gabe Schine)
		
	* Change: 
		LanguageLocalizer reworked for easier usage and caching of language
		preferences. 
		(Adam Franco)
		
	* Change: 
		The DataManager/metaData now uses the OKI Shared Ids instead of its own
		internal id system. This keeps all access to unique ids safely behind the
		Shared interface.
		(Adam Franco)
		
	* Change: 
		Themes and layouts have been completely re-worked to support easier use and
		more user control of the themes.
		(Adam Franco)
		
	* Change: 
		Argument Validator now doesn't fail on string representations of integers;
		i.e. "100" as well as 100 will validate.
		(Adam Franco)
		
	* New feature: 
		Implemented the Digital Repository OSID in Harmoni. The DR uses the
		Hierarchy OSID, the DataManager, and the Shared OSID to provide for
		high-level access and browsing of Assets and their associated data/metadata.
		(Adam Franco)
		
	* Change: 
		Services: The Harmoni Services now check for the Error Handler and use that
		to print out errors if it is available. This makes for easier to read
		backtraces. 
		(Adam Franco)
		
	* Change: 
		DBHandler: DBHandler now throws fatal errors with an explanation when a
		query fails.
		(Adam Franco)
		
	* New feature: 
		Hierarchy: Implemented the Hierarchy OSID. The Hierarchy supports the
		storing of multiple hierarchies and their nodes in one database. In the
		current implementation, the entire hierarchy is pulled from the database
		each load. This needs to be re-written to optimize it for fast reads from
		100,000+ node hierarchy (current Segue at Middlebury has ~50,000 nodes).
		(Adam Franco)
		
	* New feature: 
		DataManager: added DataSet caching to the DataSetManager. Added support for
		required fields in DataSetTypeDefinitions.
		(Gabe Schine)
		
	* Change: 
		Removed argument validation from DateTime constructor to speed up code by
		33%. 
		(Gabe Schine)
		
	* Change: 
		DataManager: sped up fetching large numbers of DataSets at once (by a factor
		of two).
		(Gabe Schine)
		
	* Change: 
		DataManager: DataSet::prune() now takes a required VersionConstraint object
		on which to base the pruning process. Handling of pruning Tags is very very
		messy, but it works.
		(Gabe Schine)
		
	* New feature: 
		DataManager: can use DataSetManager::selectIDsBySearch() to search all/some
		DataSets and return a list of DataSets that match the criteria.
		(Gabe Schine)
		
	* Change: 
		DataManager: ValueVersion::prune() now deletes itself if the DataSet it is
		part of is inactive.
		(Gabe Schine)
		
	* Change: 
		DataManager: DataSet::prune() now removes all Tags associated with itself.
		(Gabe Schine)
	



v. 0.0.5 (2004-01-09)
----------------------------------------------------

		
	* Change: 
		Implementation of the OKI SharedManager (HarmoniSharedManager) now uses the
		HarmoniDataManager's IDManager for ID creation.
		
	* Bug Fix: 
		DateTime::toString() now correctly displays minutes.
		
	* New feature: 
		Optional third argument to DataSetManager::fetchArrayOfIDs() specifies an
		array of DataSetTypes to limit the query.
		(Gabe Schine)
		
	* New feature: 
		Completed the HarmoniDataManager!
		(Gabe Schine)
		
	* Change: 
		HarmoniDataManager::setup($dbID) now takes optional second argument
		including a list of DataSetTypes to preload in a single query to save time
		and Database overhead.
		(Gabe Schine)
		
	* New feature: 
		added FloatDataType, ShortStringDataType. finished up DataManager tagging,
		cloning, pruning functionality.
		(Gabe Schine)
		
	* New feature: 
		added BooleanDataType to DataManager.
		(Gabe Schine)
		
	* New feature: 
		DataSetManager::fetchArrayOfIDs() fetches an array of DataSet ids in one SQL
		query. 
		(Gabe Schine)
		
	* New feature: 
		DateTime::compare(date1, date2) returns difference in seconds between two
		dates. 
		(Gabe Schine)
		
	* Bug Fix: 
		Typo in constructor for UnknownDBError class.
		
	* New feature: 
		Harmoni::forward(module,action) is now a synonym for
		Harmoni::ActionHandler::forward() for convenience.
		(Gabe Schine)
		
	* New feature: 
		Classes: Timer and QueryCounter for easy micro-second timing or DB query
		counting, respectively.
		(Gabe Schine)
		
	* Change: 
		Harmoni::getData has been deprecated and replaced by
		Harmoni::getAttachedData to avoid ambiguity.
		(Gabe Schine)
		
	* Change: 
		IDManager::newID() now uses auto_increment DB functionality to reduce query
		count on compatible servers.
		(Gabe Schine)
		
	* Bug Fix: 
		DataSet::populate() now sets its own ID to avoid super re-duplication of
		DataSets in database.
		(Gabe Schine)
		
	* Bug Fix: 
		DateTime::now() now gives correct Hour value. Likewise
		MySQLDatabase::toDBDate() now adds 1 to hour value to give correct 1-24
		value. Other DB Types haven't yet been checked.
		(Gabe Schine)
		
	* Change: 
		Modified field in HarmoniDataManager table "datasetfield" from
		"datasetfield_created" to "datasetfield_modified" since it is updated on
		every commit().
		(Gabe Schine)
		
	* New feature: 
		Extensive work on DataManager. Now works for creating/retrieving datasets
		with version controls.
		(Gabe Schine)
		
	* Bug Fix: 
		Corrected ArgumentValidator call in DBHandler checking for DateTimeInterface
		instead of DateTime.
		(Gabe Schine)
		
	* New feature: 
		Added AgentInformationHandler::agentExists($name, [$method]) which steps
		through each AuthenticationMethod and checks for an existing agent.
		(Gabe Schine)
		
	* Change: 
		LoginState now has better support for Active/Authenticated agents. It should
		allow one to change the active agent without disturbing the actual
		authentication process.
		(Gabe Schine)
	



v. 0.0.4 (2003-12-06)
----------------------------------------------------

		
	* New feature:

		a Queue object.
		(Gabe Schine)
		
	* Change: 
		Harmoni::attachContextData() has been renamed (again) to
		Harmoni::attachData(). Context::getData() has been moved to
		Harmoni::getData(). 
		(Gabe Schine)
		
	* Change: 
		Context object now carries an array holding the executed actions path,
		available by referencing Context::actionPath.
		(Gabe Schine)
		
	* Change: 
		ActionHander and Harmoni: ActionHandler now only passes a reference to the
		Harmoni object to action functions and scripts. Other variables are
		available here: Harmoni::HTTPVars, Harmoni::Context, Harmoni::LoginState.
		(Gabe Schine)
		
	* Change: 
		Removed many .interface.php files to save on load times and unnecessary
		flexibility. 
		(Gabe Schine)
		
	* Change: 
		LoginHandler no longer throws a default error on login failure.
		LoginHandler::setFailedLoginError() can be used to specify an error to be
		thrown to the UserError service. This change is primarily so that people
		using different languages won't be locked into using English for this error
		message (a pretty important one).
		(Gabe Schine)
		
	* Change: 
		LoginState::attachData() has been moved to Harmoni::attachContextData() and
		LoginState::getData() has been moved to Context::getData() for logical and
		organizational reasons.
		(Gabe Schine)
		
	* Change: 
		LoginHandler and Harmoni: when LoginHandler is used, the action that is
		checked for required authentication is now the LAST action executed instead
		of the first. This way, the action that finally ends up being executed is
		the "authoritative" action.
		(Gabe Schine)

		keeping track of changed values and easy validation. Intended for HTML Form
		use. 
		(Gabe Schine)
		
	* Change: 
		Various fixes to the OSIDs. Added 'requires' for classes being extended.
		Fixedsyntax errors.
		(Adam Franco)
		
	* New feature: 
		Laid out a skeleton Shared Service implementation. Currently the shared
		manager only provides for the generation of unique IDs using a database.
		(Adam Franco)
		
	* New feature: 
		Fully implemented the Hierarchy Service, the first of the OKI OSIDs to be
		implemented. The Hierarchy Service supports saving to a database as well as
		memory-only usage.
		(Adam Franco)
		
	* New feature: 
		Harmoni Users's Guide stored locally in XML format. Wrote a gen-script in
		PHP using domxml to make pretty HTML interface.
		(Gabe Schine)

	* Change: 
		New OKI interfaces, OKI gen-scripts and token files added (under harmoni/oki
		and harmoni/core/tools/oki respectively)
		(Gabe Schine)
