Name: Harmoni ChangeLog


v. 0.1.0 (2004-06-11)
----------------------------------------------------
		
	* New feature: Added a new OKI-Hiearchy implementation (hierarchy2). (Dobo Radichkov)
		
	* New feature: DataManager: added a datatype to store OKI-style types. (Gabe Schine)
		
	* Bug Fix: Bugs in LoginHandler. (Gabe Schine)
		
	* Bug Fix: #958187 Added the XOR functionality described in the manual ()	
		
	* Change: The DataManager/metaData now uses the OKI Shared Ids instead of its own internal id system. This keeps all access to unique ids safely behind the Shared interface. (Adam Franco)
		
	* Change: Themes and layouts have been completely re-worked to support easier use and more user control of the themes. (Adam Franco)
		
	* Change: Argument Validator now dosn't fail on string representations of integers; i.e. "100" as well as 100 will validate. (Adam Franco)
		
	* New feature: Implimented the Digital Repository OSID in Harmoni. The DR uses the Hierarchy OSID, the DataManager, and the Shared OSID to provide for high-level access and browsing of Assets and their associated data/metadata. (Adam Franco)
		
	* Change: Services: The Harmoni Services now check for the Error Handler and use that to print out errors if it is availible. This makes for easier to read backtraces. (Adam Franco)
		
	* Change: DBHandler: DBHandler now throws fatal errors with an explanation when a query fails. (Adam Franco)
		
	* New feature: Hierarchy: Implimented the Hierarchy OSID. The Hiearchy supports the storing of multiple hierarchies and their nodes in one database. In the current implimentation, the entire hierarchy is pulled from the database each load. This needs to be re-written to optimize it for fast reads from 100,000+ node hierarchy (current Segue at Middlebury has ~50,000 nodes). (Adam Franco)
		
	* New feature: DataManager: added DataSet caching to the DataSetManager. Added support for required fields in DataSetTypeDefinitions. (Gabe Schine)
		
	* Change: Removed argument validation from DateTime constructor to speed up code by 33%. (Gabe Schine)
		
	* Change: DataManager: sped up fetching large numbers of DataSets at once (by a factor of two). (Gabe Schine)
		
	* Change: DataManager: DataSet::prune() now takes a required VersionConstraint object on which to base the pruning process. Handling of pruning Tags is very very messy, but it works. (Gabe Schine)
		
	* New feature: DataManager: can use DataSetManager::selectIDsBySearch() to search all/some DataSets and return a list of DataSets that match the criteria. (Gabe Schine)
		
	* Change: DataManager: ValueVersion::prune() now deletes itself if the DataSet it is part of is inactive. (Gabe Schine)
		
	* Change: DataManager: DataSet::prune() now removes all Tags associated with itself. (Gabe Schine)
	
v. 0.0.5 (2004-01-09)
----------------------------------------------------
		
	* Change: Implementation of the OKI SharedManager (HarmoniSharedManager) now uses the HarmoniDataManager's IDManager for ID creation.
		
	* Bug Fix: DateTime::toString() now correctly displays minutes.
		
	* New feature: Optional third argument to DataSetManager::fetchArrayOfIDs() specifies an array of DataSetTypes to limit the query. (Gabe Schine)
		
	* New feature: Completed the HarmoniDataManager! (Gabe Schine)
		
	* Change: HarmoniDataManager::setup($dbID) now takes optional second argument including a list of DataSetTypes to preload in a single query to save time and Database overhead. (Gabe Schine)
		
	* New feature: added FloatDataType, ShortStringDataType. finished up DataManager tagging, cloning, pruning functionality. (Gabe Schine)
		
	* New feature: added BooleanDataType to DataManager. (Gabe Schine)
		
	* New feature: DataSetManager::fetchArrayOfIDs() fetches an array of DataSet ids in one SQL query. (Gabe Schine)
		
	* New feature: DateTime::compare(date1, date2) returns difference in seconds between two dates. (Gabe Schine)
		
	* Bug Fix: Typo in constructor for UnknownDBError class.
		
	* New feature: Harmoni::forward(module,action) is now a synonym for Harmoni::ActionHandler::forward() for convenience. (Gabe Schine)
		
	* New feature: Classes: Timer and QueryCounter for easy micro-second timing or DB query counting, respectively. (Gabe Schine)
		
	* Change: Harmoni::getData has been deprecated and replaced by Harmoni::getAttachedData to avoid ambiguity. (Gabe Schine)
		
	* Change: IDManager::newID() now uses auto_increment DB functionality to reduce query count on compatible servers. (Gabe Schine)
		
	* Bug Fix: DataSet::populate() now sets its own ID to avoid super re-duplication of DataSets in database. (Gabe Schine)
		
	* Bug Fix: DateTime::now() now gives correct Hour value. Likewise MySQLDatabase::toDBDate() now adds 1 to hour value to give correct 1-24 value. Other DB Types haven't yet been checked. (Gabe Schine)
		
	* Change: Modified field in HarmoniDataManager table "datasetfield" from "datasetfield_created" to "datasetfield_modified" since it is updated on every commit(). (Gabe Schine)
		
	* New feature: Extensive work on DataManager. Now works for creating/retrieving datasets with version controls. (Gabe Schine)
		
	* Bug Fix: Corrected ArgumentValidator call in DBHandler checking for DateTimeInterface instead of DateTime. (Gabe Schine)
		
	* New feature: Added AgentInformationHandler::agentExists($name, [$method]) which steps through each AuthenticationMethod and checks for an existing agent. (Gabe Schine)
		
	* Change: LoginState now has better support for Active/Authenticated agents. It should allow one to change the active agent without disturbing the actual authentication process. (Gabe Schine)
	
v. 0.0.4 (2003-12-06)
----------------------------------------------------
		
	* New feature: DateTime class has two new functions: toString() and toMDY() which display a full date/time and a MM/DD/YY string, respectfully. (Gabe Schine)
		
	* New feature: Harmoni::pathInfoParts now contains an array of PATH_INFO elements. (Gabe Schine)
		
	* New feature: ErrorHandler has new method getErrorQueue() which returns the error queue in a Queue object. (Gabe Schine)
		
	* Change: Harmoni::attachContextData() has been renamed (again) to Harmoni::attachData(). Context::getData() has been moved to Harmoni::getData(). (Gabe Schine)
		
	* Change: Context object now carries an array holding the executed actions path, available by referencing Context::actionPath. (Gabe Schine)
		
	* Change: ActionHander and Harmoni: ActionHandler now only passes a reference to the Harmoni object to action functions and scripts. Other variables are available here: Harmoni::HTTPVars, Harmoni::Context, Harmoni::LoginState. (Gabe Schine)
		
	* Change: Removed many .interface.php files to save on load times and unnecessary flexibility. (Gabe Schine)
		
	* Change: LoginHandler no longer throws a default error on login failure. LoginHandler::setFailedLoginError() can be used to specify an error to be thrown to the UserError service. This change is primarily so that people using different languages won't be locked into using English for this error message (a pretty important one). (Gabe Schine)
		
	* Change: LoginState::attachData() has been moved to Harmoni::attachContextData() and LoginState::getData() has been moved to Context::getData() for logical and organizational reasons. (Gabe Schine)
		
	* Change: LoginHandler and Harmoni: when LoginHandler is used, the action that is checked for required authentication is now the LAST action executed instead of the first. This way, the action that finally ends up being executed is the "authoritative" action. (Gabe Schine)
	
v. 0.0.3 (2003-11-26)
----------------------------------------------------
		
	* Change: Made ActionHandler check for class and method definitions before trying to execute them. (Gabe Schine)

	* Bug Fix: Numerous bug fixes in Harmoni, ActionHandler, LoginHandler (Gabe Schine)
		
	* New feature: Added a file under core/version.inc.php which holds the current harmoni versions. (Gabe Schine)
		
	* New feature: Implemented IDManager class under metaData/ to handle ID generation for the MetaData handler classes. (Gabe Schine)
		
	* Change: Updated HarmoniType OSID implementation to have a constructor that follows OKI's specifications. (Gabe Schine)
		
	* New feature: Services class now outputs a debug backtrace upon error.
		
	* Bug Fix: Fixed bug in optional arg-list for Services::startService that caused a syntax error in eval(). (Gabe Schine)
		
	* Change: Services class method startService($name) now takes optional additional arguments which are passed to the service class constructor. (Gabe Schine)
		
	* New feature: FormFieldSet class under 'utilities' combines FieldSet functionality with keeping track of changed values and easy validation. Intended for HTML Form use. (Gabe Schine)
		
	* Change: Various fixes to the OSIDs. Added 'requires' for classes being extended. Fixed syntax errors. (Adam Franco)
		
	* New feature: Laid out a skeleton Shared Service implimentation. Currently the shared manager only provides for the generation of unique IDs using a databse. (Adam Franco)
		
	* New feature: Fully implimented the Hierarchy Service, the first of the OKI OSIDs to be implimented. The Hierarchy Service supports saving to a database as well as memory-only usage. (Adam Franco)
		
	* New feature: Harmoni Users's Guide stored locally in XML format. Wrote a gen-script in PHP using domxml to make pretty HTML interface. (Gabe Schine)
		
	* Change: LanguageLocalizer now uses gettext() functions instead of home-brewed. Included PO generators, "borrowed" from the Horde project (www.horde.org). (Gabe Schine)
		
	* Change: New OKI interfaces, OKI gen-scripts and token files added (under harmoni/oki and harmoni/core/tools/oki respectively) (Gabe Schine)
	
v. 0.0.2 (2003-09-28)
----------------------------------------------------
		
	* New feature: ActionHandler::forward($action) can now be called from within an action to continue execution. (Gabe Schine)
		
	* New feature: Services::registerObjectAsService() allows you to register an already-instantiated object as a service. (Gabe Schine)
		
	* Change: Services::requireService() now returns the started service. (Gabe Schine)
		
	* Change: LanguageLocalizer files can now have comments (designated by '#') and keys/values are trimmed. (Gabe Schine)
		
	* Change: Harmoni-&gt;execute() now returns the result from the action if outputHTML = false. (Gabe Schine)
		
	* Change: DebugHandlers now store an internal output level which is used when none is passed to the Printer. (Gabe Schine)
		
	* Change: LoginState now keeps track of both an Active and Logged-in agent. (Gabe Schine)
		
	* Change: Layouts &amp; other VisualComponents now have setLevel() and getLevel() methods and store the level locally. (Gabe Schine)
		
	* Change: Template-&gt;output() now accepts a variable length argument list of FieldSets or hash tables. (Gabe Schine)
		
	* Change: Actions are now passed a reference to the Harmoni object. (Gabe Schine)

	* Change: Finished Layout, Theme and Template. (Gabe Schine)
		
	* Change: AuthenticationMethod includes changed to avoid random unprintable character output.
		
	* Change: FieldSetValidator and RuleSet now take optional argument on validate()/validateAll() functions specifying if errors should be thrown upon failure or not. (Gabe Schine)
		
	* Change: RuleSet can now accept an ErrorHandler to use via setErrorHandler(). (Gabe Schine)
		
	* New feature: DBHandler can now use a PostgreSQL server and fetching last insert ID works on all integrated DBs. (Dobo Radichkov)
		
	* Change: layoutHandler now works. Theme integration is to come. (Gabe Schine)
		
	* New feature: Database file storage method. (Max Ovsjanikovs)
		
	* New feature: Added interfaces for: VisualComponent, Layout, Menu, Content -- all part of the LayoutHandler. (Gabe Schine)
		
	* Change: AuthenticationResult now holds authenticated agent's system name as well as valid methods. (Gabe Schine)
		
	* Change: AgentInformationHandler now handles compiling of search results and returns the appropriate array format. (Gabe Schine)
		
	* Change: AuthenticationMethod::getAgentInformation now returns an associative array of [username]=&gt;array([key1]=&gt;value1,...),... (Gabe Schine)
