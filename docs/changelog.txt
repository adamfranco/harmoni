v. 0.13.1 (2007-10-22)
----------------------------------------------------
This release fixes a few issues that were missed in the last point release.
		
		
	* Bug Fix: 
		ErrorHandler: Now doesn't halt if exceptions are thrown during error
		logging. 
		(2007-10-22 - Adam Franco)
		
	* Bug Fix:

		(2007-10-22 - Adam Franco)
	
v. 0.13.0 (2007-10-22)
----------------------------------------------------
New in this relase include the addition of alternate repository implementations for
reading from simple database tables and federating together several different
repository implementations.

Also, Be sure to point the database updater script
(harmoni/core/DBHandler/db_updater.php) at your harmoni databases to add new columns
that changed in harmoni-0.11.0 and harmoni-0.12.0.

Changes to the Logging tables require running a database updater script:
harmoni/core/DBHandler/db_updater.php 
		
		
	* New feature: 
		A new repository implementation, SimpleTableRepository, exposes simple
		database table rows as Assets.
		(2007-10-05 - Adam Franco)
		
	* Bug Fix: 
		A new RepositoryManager implementation, FederationRepositoryManager, allows
		the usage of multiple Repository implementations.
		(2007-10-05 - Adam Franco)
		
	* Change: 
		Many implementations are now throwing OsidExceptions such as the
		UnimplementedException, UnknownIdException, etcetera, to allow these to be
		caught separately from generic errors.
		(2007-10-05 - Adam Franco)
		
	* Change: 
		AuthZ: The Authorization caching system now searches for and verifies the
		existance of qualifier Ids passed to it. It caches a list of unknown ids and
		throws an UnknownId Exception when asked about that qualifier. This change
		prevents the AuthorizationCache from continually rechecking authorizations
		for qualifiers it will never match, such as those in non-HarmoniRepository
		Repository implementations.
		(2007-10-05 - Adam Franco)
		
	* Bug Fix: 
		AuthN/LDAP: Previously, when users where members of objects that were not
		under the baseDN, searching for parent groups fell into an infinite loop.
		(2007-10-05 - Adam Franco)
		
	* Bug Fix: 
		SQL: Adding a harmoni-0.11.0 database updator that will add the 'creator'
		field to the dr_asset_info table.

	* New feature: 
		Custom error_handling function.
		(2007-10-09 - Adam Franco)
		
	* Change: #1810364 
		The HarmoniRepositoryManager object is now passed to the objects it creates
		rather than being accessed globally from within its implementation peventing
		conflicts when multiple RepositoryManager implementations exist.
		(2007-10-09 - Adam Franco)
		
	* Bug Fix: 
		Fixing a number of E_STRICT notices and improving the class and interface
		hierarchies. 
		(2007-10-10 - Adam Franco)
		
	* New feature: 
		Improved Error and Exception handling class, HarmoniErrorHandler. Adds
		unified Error and Exception printing and logging.
		(2007-10-10 - Adam Franco)

		addDerivedTable($subQuery, $joinType, $joinCondition, $alias) method.
		(2007-10-11 - Adam Franco)
		
	* Bug Fix: 
		Logging: Log-browsing has been dramatically speeded up by refactoring its
		queries and indexes.
		(2007-10-11 - Adam Franco)
		
	**** IMPORTANT *** Change:

		(2007-10-12 - Adam Franco)
		
	* Change: 
		Removing unneeded $harmoni paramaters from Action Source methods.
		(2007-10-17 - Adam Franco)
		
	* Bug Fix:

		(2007-09-14 - Adam Franco)
	
v. 0.12.0 (2007-09-13)
----------------------------------------------------

		
	**** IMPORTANT *** Change: 
		In order to support PostgreSQL without refactoring of the Database Handler,
		column names have been all made lowercase. To update a currently populated
		harmoni database to the new names, run the following updater script:
		harmoni/core/DBHandler/db_updater.php 
		(2007-09-11 - Adam Franco)
		
		
	**** IMPORTANT *** Change: 
		Hierarchy: The node relation and ancestory tables, j_node_node and
		node_ancestory were both missing a reference to the hierarchy for which the
		node id was valid. This could cause conflicts if node ids are repeated in
		separate hiearchies. Existing Harmoni databases will need to have these
		columns added and the data updated.
		(2007-09-13 - Adam Franco)
		
		
	**** IMPORTANT *** Change: 
		Scheduling: Two sc_item columns "start" and "end" conflict with reserved
		words in PostgreSQL. Existing Harmoni databases will need to have these
		columns added and the data updated.
		(2007-09-13 - Adam Franco)
		
		
	* Change: 
		DBHandler: The PostGre classes have all been renamed to PostgreSQL
		(2007-09-14 - Adam Franco)

		printing. 
		(2007-09-13 - Adam Franco)

		PostgreSQL. 
		(2007-09-13 - Adam Franco)

	* New feature: 
		DBHandler: Can now run an entire directory tree full of sql files.
		(2007-09-11 - Adam Franco)
		
	* Bug Fix: 
		DBHandler: Some fixes to the PostgreSQL implementation and tests.
		(2007-09-11 - Adam Franco)
		
	* New feature: 
		DBHandler: New database updater utility. The only function implemented
		currently is to convert column names to lowercase.
		(2007-09-11 - Adam Franco)
		
	* Bug Fix: 
		ErrorHandler: Fixed HTML syntax error in Exception printing.
		(2007-09-11 - Adam Franco)

		(Adam Franco)
		
	* Change: 
		GUI: Y-Layout now uses div tags instead of tables to allow the setting of
		child widths.
		(Adam Franco)
		
	* Change: 
		Removing ampersands for compatability with other PHP5 code. The BBEdit-grep
		string used for the find and replace was:
		
		(function )&amp;|(=\s?)&amp;([^a-z#])|([^&amp;])&amp;\s?(\$)
		
		replaced with
		
		\1\2\3\4\5
		
		
		
		Special Changes were made to the following files to
		fix problems introduced in the search and repace for ampersands:
		
		polyphony/main/library/ResultPrinter/ArrayResultPrinter.class.php - getLayout()
		
		- $item = $this-&gt;_array[key($this-&gt;_array)];
		
		======
		
		+ $item = current($this-&gt;_array);
		
		harmoni/core/oki2/repository/HarmoniRecord.class.php - getParts()
		
		- Moved the following line out of the if-statement:
		
		- $activeValue = $allRecordFieldValues[$key]-&gt;getActiveVersion();
		
		harmoni/core/oki2/hierarchy/tree/Tree.class.php - _traverse()
		
		- Kept the first parameter being passed by reference. Needed in this
		case.

v. 0.5.0 (2005-01-10)
----------------------------------------------------

		
	* New feature: 
		Authz: IsUserAuthorized caching system to dramatically speed authorization

		(Adam Franco)
		
	* New feature: 
		GUI: New basic theme.
		(Adam Franco)
		
	* New feature: 
		Id: Id table now only retains the most recent value instead of all used

		(Adam Franco)
		
	* Change: 
		Removed error supression from the ActionHandler to allow errors to be shown
		during action-class instantiation.
		(Adam Franco)
		
	* Change:

		(Adam Franco)
		
	* Bug Fix: 
		Repository: Repository-&gt;getAsset() was doing extra work verifying the

		(Adam Franco)
		
	* Change: 
		Added a check for magic_quotes_gpc being Off in harmoni.inc.php.
		(Gabe Schine)

		Implemented (but did not yet test) Oracle database connectivity.
		(Gabe Schine)
		
	* Change: 
		Changed DBHandler's toDBDate functionality to automatically format and
		include quotations if necessary for the specific DB type. This became a
		problem for Oracle databases where a function call is necessary for date
		storage. 
		(Gabe Schine)
		
	* New feature: 
		Added getStringName() to the Database interface and added a method in the
		DBHandler to allows access to the string name based on the database index.
		(Gabe Schine)
		
	* Change: #116890 
		All DataManager database queries now free() their results after processing.
		(Gabe Schine)
		
	* New feature: 
		GUIManager now allows for the setting of pre and post HTML. These are HTML
		tags that need to surround a compontent. This is primarily used to properly
		nest form-tags around tables/divs to generate valid XHTML.
		(Adam Franco)
		
	* Bug Fix: 
		Repaired many PHP notices.
		(Adam Franco)
		
	* Bug Fix: 
		Repaired many PHP notices.
		(Gabe Schine)
		
	* Bug Fix: 
		Repaired many PHP notices.
		(Niraj Dhungel)
		
	* Bug Fix: 
		The hierarchy cache had a problem where _isCached() was called as a property
		instead of a method, square brackets [] versus parenthasis (), and was
		breaking the cache by creating nodes that were listed as children of other
		nodes, but did not have their parents listed.
		(Adam Franco)
		
	* Change: 
		The Chronology Library as well as the dataManager primitives have now been
		moved to core/Primitives and generalized.
		(Adam Franco)
		
	* Change: 
		The Time and DateTime classes have been removed and their functionality
		replaced by the new Chronology DateAndTime class.
		(Adam Franco)
		
	* Change: 
		DataManager: no longer have an active state. They either exist or they don't.
		
		Fields that are deleted now are actually removed from the DB if the
		Record is not version controlled.
		
		getIndices() now returns only the active indices per default, including
		inactive ones only if requested.
		(Gabe Schine)
		
	* New feature: 
		Added a free() call to the SelectQueryResult classes to free memory used by
		the select query.
		(Gabe Schine)
		
	* New feature: 
		Added the chronology library, a PHP implemenation of the Squeak (Smalltalk)
		Kernel-Chronology package and aims to serve as a general PHP class-library
		for handling, comparing, and operating on chronological objects. The
		original Smalltalk implementation is licensed under the Squeak License http://squeak.org/download/license.html.
		
		This library includes classes that represent instants in time
		(DateAndTime, TimeStamp), lengths of time (Duration), spans of time anchored
		at certain instants (Timespan, Year, Month, Week, Date), as well as recuring
		instants across a span of time (Schedule).
		
		This library has been designed to support all possible dates, times, and
		durations, not just those since the UNIX epoch (1970). dates can have
		positive years (C.E./A.D.) or negative years (B.C.E./B.C.) and Durations
		have been tested to support lengths of time up to +/- 4 billion years with
		second-precision. Beyond 4 billion years to the limit of testing (50 billion
		years) Durations have hour-precision.
		(Adam Franco)
		
	* New feature: 
		Added URL-writing functionality as well as centralized processing of
		request-related variables from/to the browser into a family of classes
		related to the RequestHandler. 
		
		All 'communication' between the browser and the program is now abstracted
		and can be subsequently changed transparently.
		(Gabe Schine)
		
	* Change: 
		In order to allow for globally unique ids from the IdManager, the IdManager
		now allows for an Id prefix to place on ids. The prefix 'id.middlebury.edu-'
		would lead to ids simmilar to 'id.middlebury.edu-1234567890'. This will
		allow for multiple IdManagers to be used together without each giving out
		the same Id strings.
		(Adam Franco)
		
	* Change: 
		In conjunction with the IdManager's added 'prefix' capabilities, the Harmoni
		SQL table definitions have been updated to support the storing of string Ids
		(currently up to 75 characters) that may have originated from the IdManager.
		Ids generated internally by the database remain as integers.
		(Adam Franco)
		
	* Change: 
		In conjunction with the IdManager's added 'prefix' capabilities, the Harmoni
		services that store Ids have been upgraded to allow string ids as well as
		integer ids.
		(Adam Franco)

	* Bug Fix: 
		Services weren't starting because of case problems with the get_class()
		functions in PHP5.
		(Adam Franco)
		
	* Bug Fix:

		arrays instead of dying with errors.
		(Adam Franco)
		
	**** IMPORTANT *** Change: 
		Harmoni now runs on PHP5 and on Win32 systems in addition to PHP4.3 and
		POSIX systems.
		(Adam Franco)

		Agent searching works with new mapping system.
		(Adam Franco)
	
v. 0.3.0 (2005-04-07)
----------------------------------------------------

		
	* Change: 
		New Framework/Architecture-GUI/Theme interaction decouples the Harmoni
		object from the output system. The GUIManager and other OutputHandlers
		extend the OutputHandler abstract class and can be attached to Harmoni. A
		default 'BasicOutputHandler' is used when no other OutputHandler is
		specified. 
		(Adam Franco)
		
	* Change: 
		Services::startService(), Services::stopService(),
		Services::restartService(), and Services::startAll() are now deprecated and
		print warnings if used. Please use Services::startManagerAsService() and/or
		Services::getService() instead.
		(Adam Franco)
		
	* Change: 
		'Service' classes no longer extend the services interface or use
		start()/stop() methods. These had been designed into Harmoni, but were never
		used and are now removed. start()/stop() methods will NOT be called during
		service starting/stopping.
		(Adam Franco)
		
	* Change: 
		OKI version 1 interfaces and implementations have been removed, saving 2MB
		of files and cleaning up the source tree.
		(Adam Franco)
		
	* Change: 
		The hierarchy's Tree class, HierarchyManager/tree/Tree.class.php, now caches
		its traversal results. (Savings: 93,529 calls to tree-&gt;_traverse(), 43
		seconds execution time on a 500MHz PC in a 5000-node hierarchy)
		(Adam Franco)
		
	* New feature: 
		ValidatorRule objects can now be accessed via static
		XxxxxValidatorRule::getRule() methods, allowing the ValidatorRule classes to
		behave as Singletons and avoid the instantiation of tens of thousands of
		ValidatorRule objects.
		(Adam Franco)
		
	* New feature: 
		GUI Manager now complete. ThemeHandler and LayoutHandler have been removed.
		(Dobo Radichkov)
		
	* New feature: 
		GUI Manager saving functionality.
		(Nikitas Stamatopoulos)

		OsidManagers can now be started and configured by
		Services::startManagerAsService("name", $context, $configuration);
		(Adam Franco)
		
	* New feature: 
		Service names can now have aliases.
		(Adam Franco)
		
	* Change: 
		Authentication is completely handled by the AuthenticationManager OSID
		implementation instead of the LoginHandler/AuthenticationHandler. The
		LoginHandler and AuthenticationHandler have been removed.
		(Adam Franco)
		
	* New feature: 
		New back-end for managing authentication tokens, agents, and the mappings
		between agents and authentication tokens. This is all contained within the
		core/oki2/agentmanagement/ directory.
		(Adam Franco)
		
	* Change: 
		DBHandler now provides methods for transaction handling. Applications can be
		coded to use transactions to ensure atomic writes. Databases that do not
		support transactions will simply ignore the calls. Nested transaction calls
		in MySQL are interperated so that only the outer transaction is run allowing
		applications coded to use nested transactions to often operate on MySQL
		4.0.11+. 
		(Adam Franco)
		
	* New feature: 
		Now includes implementations of v2.0 of the O.K.I OSIDs.
		(Adam Franco)
		
	* New feature: 
		Now includes v2.0 of the O.K.I OSIDs.
		(Adam Franco)
		
	* Bug Fix: 
		AuthorizationManager now handles group membership.
		(Adam Franco)
		
	* Change: 
		AuthorizationManager now properly returns implicit AZ corresponding to
		explicit AZs at a parent instead of returning the explict AZs themselves.
		(Adam Franco)
		
	* Change: 
		DataManager: added function to SchemaManager to generate valid PHP code for
		a given Schema.
		(Gabe Schine)
		
	* Change: 
		DataManager: deleting a value from a Record without version control now
		actually deletes the value instead of flagging it as inactive.
		(Gabe Schine)
		
	* Change: 
		The LanguageLocalizer now defines functions for _() and gettext() that
		simply return the passed string, so that localized apps can fail gracefully
		to their native language if gettext is not installed.
		(Adam Franco)
		
	* Change: 
		DBHandler improvements: SQL strings are prettier now. Also added variable
		binding functionallity.
		(Dobo Radichkov)
	
v. 0.2.0 (2004-10-26)
----------------------------------------------------

		
	* New feature: 
		Added a "MIME" service for sniffing mime types from file extensions.
		(Adam Franco)
		
	* New feature: 
		Added an ImageProcessor service for the resizing of images, generation of
		thumbnails, and other common image processing functions. This service can be
		configured to use multiple modules to handle different file types, as
		availible. An example would be using PHP's GD libraries for handling jpegs
		and pngs, while using ImageMagick (via shell_exec()) for tiff, psd, pdf,
		etc. files.
		(Adam Franco)
		
	* Bug Fix: 
		DBHandler: PostgreSQL now functions without throwing invalid errors.
		(Adam Franco)
		
	* New feature: 
		Digital Repository: Now has a "File" Info structure system for storing
		binary files.
		(Adam Franco)
		
	* Change: 
		Digital Repository: Now stores Asset dates outside of the the data manager.
		(Adam Franco)

		after executing the action requested by the end user.
		(Gabe Schine)
		
	* New feature: 
		Harmoni::executeLogin() executes the LoginHandler and stores the result to
		avoid discrepancies.
		(Gabe Schine)
		
	* Change: 
		Migrated OKI DR implementation to use new DataManager.
		(Gabe Schine)
		
	* Change: 
		DataManager: Records now dynamically update their fetch-mode (how much &amp;
		what data has been fetched) depending on the operation to be performed.
		Previous version required one to manually re-fetch records (annoying).
		(Gabe Schine)
		
	* New feature: 
		Function printDebugBacktrace([$traceArray]) will print out a
		debug_backtrace() in a pretty way.
		(Gabe Schine)
		
	* New feature: 
		DataManager: Record::getValuesArray() returns an associative array of all
		active values in a Record.
		(Gabe Schine)
		
	* New feature: 
		DateTime::toString() now has optional parameter to return a shorter M/D/Y
		for the date instead of Month DD, YYYY.
		(Gabe Schine)
		
	* Bug Fix: #102455 
		AuthN queries now have slashes added to dbc query values.
		(Adam Franco)
		
	* Bug Fix: #102455

	* New feature: 
		A new "Sets" service provides an easy system for the creation, ordering, and
		maintaining of persistant collections of Ids.
		(Adam Franco)
		
	* New feature: 
		Added new system for storing primitive data values in objects (all classes
		implementing the Primitive interface - see
		harmoni/core/dataManager/primitives) 
		(Gabe Schine)
		
	* New feature: 
		Re-worked the DataManager with simpler class names and more flexibility.
		(see harmoni/core/dataManager)
		(Gabe Schine)
		
	* New feature: 
		Added a "revision" to all DataSetTypeDefinitions for later program upgrades
		(can check revision number to see if the structure is up-to-date instead of
		comparing every field).
		(Gabe Schine)
		
	* New feature: 
		GUIManager service, based around CSS, will eventually replace the
		theme/layout handlers.
		(Dobo Radichkov)
		
	* New feature: 
		Implemented the Authorization OSID.
		(Dobo Radichkov)
		
	* Change: 
		Reworked the Hierarchy implementation to use a better data-fetching/caching

		(Dobo Radichkov)
	
v. 0.1.0 (2004-06-11)
----------------------------------------------------

		
	* New feature: 
		Added a new OKI-Hiearchy implementation (hierarchy2).
		(Dobo Radichkov)
		
	* New feature: 
		DataManager: added a datatype to store OKI-style types.
		(Gabe Schine)
		
	* Bug Fix: 
		Bugs in LoginHandler.
		(Gabe Schine)
		
	* Change: 
		LanguageLocalizer reworked for easier usage and caching of language
		preferences. 
		(Adam Franco)
		
	* Change: 
		The DataManager/metaData now uses the OKI Shared Ids instead of its own
		internal id system. This keeps all access to unique ids safely behind the
		Shared interface.
		(Adam Franco)
		
	* Change: 
		Themes and layouts have been completely re-worked to support easier use and
		more user control of the themes.
		(Adam Franco)
		
	* Change: 
		Argument Validator now dosn't fail on string representations of integers;
		i.e. "100" as well as 100 will validate.
		(Adam Franco)
		
	* New feature: 
		Implimented the Digital Repository OSID in Harmoni. The DR uses the
		Hierarchy OSID, the DataManager, and the Shared OSID to provide for
		high-level access and browsing of Assets and their associated data/metadata.
		(Adam Franco)
		
	* Change: 
		Services: The Harmoni Services now check for the Error Handler and use that
		to print out errors if it is availible. This makes for easier to read
		backtraces. 
		(Adam Franco)
		
	* Change: 
		DBHandler: DBHandler now throws fatal errors with an explanation when a
		query fails.
		(Adam Franco)
		
	* New feature: 
		Hierarchy: Implimented the Hierarchy OSID. The Hiearchy supports the storing
		of multiple hierarchies and their nodes in one database. In the current
		implimentation, the entire hierarchy is pulled from the database each load.
		This needs to be re-written to optimize it for fast reads from 100,000+ node
		hierarchy (current Segue at Middlebury has ~50,000 nodes).
		(Adam Franco)
		
	* New feature: 
		DataManager: added DataSet caching to the DataSetManager. Added support for
		required fields in DataSetTypeDefinitions.
		(Gabe Schine)
		
	* Change: 
		Removed argument validation from DateTime constructor to speed up code by
		33%. 
		(Gabe Schine)
		
	* Change: 
		DataManager: sped up fetching large numbers of DataSets at once (by a factor
		of two).
		(Gabe Schine)
		
	* Change: 
		DataManager: DataSet::prune() now takes a required VersionConstraint object
		on which to base the pruning process. Handling of pruning Tags is very very
		messy, but it works.
		(Gabe Schine)
		
	* New feature: 
		DataManager: can use DataSetManager::selectIDsBySearch() to search all/some
		DataSets and return a list of DataSets that match the criteria.
		(Gabe Schine)
		
	* Change: 
		DataManager: ValueVersion::prune() now deletes itself if the DataSet it is
		part of is inactive.
		(Gabe Schine)
		
	* Change: 
		DataManager: DataSet::prune() now removes all Tags associated with itself.
		(Gabe Schine)
	
v. 0.0.5 (2004-01-09)
----------------------------------------------------

		
	* Change: 
		Implementation of the OKI SharedManager (HarmoniSharedManager) now uses the
		HarmoniDataManager's IDManager for ID creation.
		
	* Bug Fix: 
		DateTime::toString() now correctly displays minutes.
		
	* New feature: 
		Optional third argument to DataSetManager::fetchArrayOfIDs() specifies an
		array of DataSetTypes to limit the query.
		(Gabe Schine)
		
	* New feature: 
		Completed the HarmoniDataManager!
		(Gabe Schine)
		
	* Change: 
		HarmoniDataManager::setup($dbID) now takes optional second argument
		including a list of DataSetTypes to preload in a single query to save time
		and Database overhead.
		(Gabe Schine)
		
	* New feature: 
		added FloatDataType, ShortStringDataType. finished up DataManager tagging,
		cloning, pruning functionality.
		(Gabe Schine)
		
	* New feature: 
		added BooleanDataType to DataManager.
		(Gabe Schine)
		
	* New feature: 
		DataSetManager::fetchArrayOfIDs() fetches an array of DataSet ids in one SQL
		query. 
		(Gabe Schine)
		
	* New feature: 
		DateTime::compare(date1, date2) returns difference in seconds between two
		dates. 
		(Gabe Schine)
		
	* Bug Fix: 
		Typo in constructor for UnknownDBError class.
		
	* New feature: 
		Harmoni::forward(module,action) is now a synonym for
		Harmoni::ActionHandler::forward() for convenience.
		(Gabe Schine)
		
	* New feature: 
		Classes: Timer and QueryCounter for easy micro-second timing or DB query
		counting, respectively.
		(Gabe Schine)
		
	* Change: 
		Harmoni::getData has been deprecated and replaced by
		Harmoni::getAttachedData to avoid ambiguity.

		message (a pretty important one).
