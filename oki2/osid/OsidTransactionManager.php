/**
 * OsidTransactionManager is the key binding for controlling persistent store
 * transactions from an application or an implementation of an OSID.
 * Operations involved with these methods have the following characteristics:
 * 
 * <p>
 * either the entire set of actions occurs or nothing happens;
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * actions occurring within a transaction are hidden from other concurrent
 * transactions;
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * successfully committed transactions result in a consistent persisted data
 * store.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * mark() identifies a point in processing.  After mark(), at any point up
 * until commit() is called, a call to rollback() causes all processing after
 * mark() to be ignored.  The system is the same state it was at the time
 * mark() was called.  If instead commit() is called after mark(), all
 * processing since mark() was called is made permanent.  Once committed,
 * these actions cannot be rolled back.
