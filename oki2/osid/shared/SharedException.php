 * OsidException or one of its subclasses is thrown by all methods of all
 * interfaces of an Open Service Interface Definition (OSID). This requires
 * the caller of an OSID package method handle the OsidException. Since the
 * application using an OSID can not determine where an implementation method
 * will ultimately execute, it must assume a worst case scenerio and protect
 * itself. OSID Implementations should throw their own subclasses of
 * OsidException and limit exception messages to those predefined by their own
 * OsidException or its superclasses. This approach to exception messages
 * allows Applications and OSID implementations using an OsidException's
 * predefined messages to handle exceptions in an interoperable way.
