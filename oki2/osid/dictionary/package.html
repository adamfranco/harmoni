  <p>Dictionary Open Service Interface Definition.</p>
  <p>
    Dictionary provides services for associating a general
    identifier, a domain-specific identifier, and an object.
    An application can query for the object appropriate
    for a given entry by supplying a tag and a domain.
  </p>
  <p>
    Dictionary can be used for simple entry localization by
    using locale (a country, language, variant) as the domain.
    Dictionary can also be used to facilitate application deployment
    by abstracting context-sensitive information by using application
    type as the domain.
