  <p>
    Logging Open Service Interface Definition provides an abstraction layer between a platform-specific logging system and an application. The basic logging services include creating logs, appending content to a log, and reading information from a log. Logs are classified with regard to whether they can be read from or written to.

    Additionally, there are a set of services for associating a priority strings with some log content and material can be read from the log filtering for specific priorities. Also there is support for formatting to accompany content.
