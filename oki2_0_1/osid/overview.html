  <p>
    The Open Service Interface Definition (OSID) defines an open and extensible architecture for general purpose infrastructure. The org.osid package provides detailed specifications for interfaces to common infrastructural services. The OSID architecture is intended for both commercial product vendors and non-commercial product developers. It provides a stable, scalable base that supports the flexibility needed for increasingly integrated processes.

The original development of the OSIDs was conducted by the Open Knowledge Initiative (O.K.I.) project with funding from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation.
